D. Risk Factors - Impact of inflation may adversely affect our financial expenses and operating income" and “- Currency fluctuations might affect our operating results and translation of operating results." 66 Any devaluation of the NIS against various non-Israeli currencies in which we or our suppliers pay for imported goods has the effect of increasing the selling price of those products which we sell in Israel in NIS and affecting our operating results. In particular, a devaluation of the NIS against the Chinese currency could significantly increase the cost of production of our non-food products at our Bee Group stores and the selling price of those products to our customers. An increase in price of imported goods by our suppliers can usually be offset by an increase in the consumer price of such goods. This devaluation would have a greater affect on our non-food retail business because a higher proportion of the goods that we sell in our Bee Group stores is acquired from suppliers overseas. This devaluation would also cause an increase in our expenses as recorded in our NIS denominated financial results even though the expenses denominated in non-Israeli currencies will remain unchanged. In addition, because our financial results are denominated in NIS and are translated into US dollars for the convenience of US investors, currency fluctuations of the NIS against the US dollar may impact our US dollar translated financial results. Political Conditions We and all of our subsidiaries are incorporated under Israeli law and our principal offices and operations are located in the State of Israel. Political, economic, security and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying from time to time, in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. Israel has not entered into any peace agreement with Syria and Lebanon. In the last few years, the establishment of a Hamas government in Gaza has created additional unrest and uncertainty in the region and has increased hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians. These hostilities have included terrorist acts in Israel and military operations in the West Bank and Gaza. These hostilities had a negative effect on the Israeli economy. In December 2008 Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which reduced the sales of some of our stores that are located in the southern region of Israel. In July 2006, a conflict with Hezbollah escalated significantly on Israel’s northern border, as a result of which a number of our stores located in the northern region did not operate according to their usual schedule. We cannot predict the effect on our business if hostilities are renewed or the security situation deteriorates in any part of the country. The future of Israel’s relations with its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians is uncertain and several countries, companies and organizations continue to restrict business with Israel and with Israeli companies. We believe that in the past, these practices have not had a material adverse effect on us. However, we could be adversely affected by adverse developments in Israel’s relationships with its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, or by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed towards Israel or Israeli businesses. Most of Bee Group's imports during 2008 were from suppliers located in China. Because most of the products sold by the Bee Group are manufactured overseas and imported from China, its activity may be affected by changes in the political and economic conditions in China. 67 In addition, because the Bee Group acquires most of its products from suppliers outside of Israel, and most of its products are imported via the sea, a prolonged general strike, shutdown or a disruption of any of the Israeli ports for an extended period of time, including as a result of a military conflict, would affect our ability to import such products or increase their prices. In addition, since the peak selling season of some of our Bee Group stores is during the holidays, disruptions in the ports during or adjacent to such holiday seasons may adversely affect our sales and financial results. Economic Conditions All of our supermarket sales are made in Israel and we acquire a substantial majority of the goods that we sell from Israeli suppliers. Consequently, our financial performance is dependent to a significant extent on the economy of Israel. During 2007 and 2008, Israel's Gross Domestic Product rose by 5.3% and 4.1%, respectively. However, in recent quarters, the global economic crisis, instability and uncertainty have affected the economic conditions in Israel. Initial reports indicate that the Israeli economy declined by 3.9% (annualized) at the first quarter of 2009. We believe that the economic slowdown in Israel is affecting the buying patterns of our customers, as more customers are shifting their purchases to low-price and hard discount stores, which have a lower profit margin. As a result, we have expanded our low-price and hard discount store formats. We expect the economic slowdown in Israel to adversely affect our financial performance, among other things, by reducing our sales and our profitability. The global economic crisis has also affected our non-food retail business by causing a slowdown in the growth of private consumption, which could affect the growth of our houseware, home textile and baby and young children accessories businesses. In addition, the global economic crisis has also reduced the availability of credit, increased the costs of financing and the terms under which banks agree to provide financing. These developments may reduce the sales of our businesses, increase our costs of borrowing and reduce our profitability. We are unable at this time to asses the extent, if any, of the impact that the global economic crisis may have on our business.. In addition, on May 13, 2009, Israel's cabinet approved the proposed state budgets for the years 2009 and 2010, which include, among other things, a temporary increase of 1% in the value added tax ("VAT") from 15.5% to 16.5% for an 18-month period, and an imposition of VAT, for the first time, on fruits and vegetables. The temporary increase in VAT to 16.5% is effective, although the proposal to impose VAT on fruits and vegetables is subject to change. The Knesset (Israeli legislative body) is expected to vote on the budget by mid-July. The increase in VAT and the new imposition of VAT on fruits and vegetables will increase the cost of the products that we sell in our supermarkets and may affect our sales. 68 Trade Agreements Israel is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. Israel is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which provides for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers among its members. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the Generalized System of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by these programs either duty-free or at reduced tariffs. In addition, Israel, the EU (known as the European Union), and the European Free Trade Association have a free trade agreement. In recent years, Israel has established commercial and trade relations with a number of other nations, including China, India, Russia, Turkey and other nations in Eastern Europe and Asia. Corporate Tax Rate We are subject to income tax in Israel at the rate of 26% of our taxable income in 2009 (27% in 2008). The income of the Company and its subsidiaries is taxed at the regular rate. In July 2004, an amendment (No. 140) to the Income Tax Ordinance was enacted. One of the provisions of this amendment is that the corporate tax rate is to be gradually reduced from 36% in 2003, to 30% in 2004. In August 2005, a further amendment (No. 147) was published, which makes a further revision to the corporate tax rates prescribed by Amendment No. 140. As a result of the aforementioned amendments, the corporate tax rates for 2004 and thereafter are as follows: 2004 - 35%, 2005 - 34%, 2006 - 31%, 2007 - 29%, 2008 - 27%, 2009 - - 26% and for 2010 and thereafter - 25%. Under the Inflationary Adjustments Law, carry forward losses were linked to the CPI. In February 2008, the Knesset (Israeli legislative body) passed a law according to which the provisions of Inflationary Adjustments Law will no longer apply to the Company in 2008 and thereafter. For further tax information, see “Item 10. Additional Information - E. Taxation -Israeli Tax Considerations.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and could have a material impact on our reported results. 69 We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain Impairment of non financial assets We review at each balance sheet date whether any events have occurred or changes in circumstances have taken place which might indicate that there has been an impairment of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles. When such indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate whether the carrying value of the asset in our accounts can be recovered from the cash flows anticipated from that asset, and, if necessary, records an impairment provision necessary to adjust the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. When it is not possible to assess whether an impairment provision is required for an individual asset which does not generate independent cash flows, the need for such a provision is assessed in relation to the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit to which that asset belongs. For a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, any impairment loss relating to that unit initially reduces the goodwill and the balance reduces the carrying amount of the other assets. In 2007, we evaluated impairment separately for each store as a cash-generating unit. In 2008, we reorganized the food retail activities to incorporate all activities under one subsidiary while, at the same time, organized the brand names in order that we could meet the needs of specific customers in each geographic area (promotions, prices and variety) and increase customer loyalty program activities. As such, in 2008, we evaluated impairment separately for each store or the cash-generating unit to which the store belongs when the cash inflows of one store are dependent on the cash inflows of another store in the same geographic area. In evaluating impairment, we consider corporate assets relating to the stores or other cash-generating units as well as indirect costs that are directly attributable, or that can be reasonably and consistently allocated, to the stores or cash generating units. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of the net selling price of the asset's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. These calculations require the use of estimates. In calculating the impairment for the reported years, based on discounted expected future cash flows, we used a discount rate before tax for each cash-generating unit (CGU). For discount rates used by the Company, see note 8C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, we recorded impairment provisions resulting in net amount of NIS 3.4 million. In 2007, we recorded a reversal of impairment provisions resulting in the net amount of NIS 13.5 million. Impairment provisions or the reversal of such provisions are included in the income statement within Other gain or losses. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing long-lived assets for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results 70 Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefits from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Goodwill is allocated to three identified groups of cash-generating units. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and management estimation covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates. Results of the goodwill impairment for each cash-generating unit (CGU) review performed during 2008 are summarized in Note 8C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The key assumptions used for value in-use calculations are as follows: expected gross margin, weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget management estimations covering a five-year period, and pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections. The annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgments and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Similar to our policy on impairment of long-lived assets, the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items, such as inflation, business valuations in the market, the economy and market competition. Revaluation of investment property Investment property is presented at fair value. In certain cases, fair value is determined using discounted cash flows that are based on assumptions as to discount rate. Changes in the discount rate will change the calculated fair value and may therefore materially affect the results of our operations. The range of discount rates used is 8%-12% per annum (mainly 8-8.75%). Retirement benefit obligations and Provision for unutilized sick leave 1) Retirement benefit obligations Labor laws and agreements, and the practice, require us to pay retirement benefits to employees dismissed or retiring in certain other circumstances. 71 We operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. We have both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Our obligation to pay retirement benefits is generally treated as a defined benefit plan. However, for employees for whom the retirement benefit obligation is covered by section 14 of the Israel Severance Pay Law, the obligation is treated as a defined contribution plan. Defined Benefit Plan The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows (after taking into account the expected rate of salary increases and other actuarial assumptions) by reference to Israeli Government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. We determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the retirement obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the interest rates of Israeli government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity that are comparable to the terms of the related retirement liability. The present value of the obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost of retirement benefits include the discount rate. Other key assumptions, such as future wage increases and retirement rates, are based in part on current market conditions and on past experience. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized outside of profit and loss in the "statement of recognized income and expense" in the period in which they arise. Defined Contribution Plan A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which we pay fixed contributions into a separate entity. Our obligation to the employees for whom the retirement benefit obligation is covered by section 14 of the Israel Severance Pay Law as part of the defined contribution plan is to make regular contributions to a separate and independent entity, and we have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. 72 2) Provision for unutilized sick leave Pursuant to employment agreements, certain employees are entitled to receive payment for a certain number of sick leave days per year which accumulate to future periods. Under these said agreements, the Company has undertaken to pay each employee, upon retirement, certain amounts which depend on the balance of the unutilized days and on the cumulative number of sick leave days the employee has utilized during his employment with the Company. The provision for unutilized sick leave is based on an annual actuarial calculation: in making such a computation, the actuary makes actuarial assumptions (such as the rates of employee turnover, future salary levels). The cost of this benefit is recognized using the same method used for defined benefit retirement plans. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized outside of profit or loss in the Statement of Recognized Income and Expense the period in which they arise. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of the obligations. For key management assumption used in the annual actuarial calculation for retirement benefit obligations and provision for unutilized sick leave, see note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Provisions for claims The provisions for legal claims are recorded based on the estimates of our management (after consulting with the legal counsel) as to the likelihood that cash flows will be required to settle these liabilities and as to the amount of such cash flows. Income taxes and deferred taxes There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates as to whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. In addition, we recognize deferred tax assets and tax liabilities based on the difference between the carrying value of such assets and liabilities and their amount for tax purposes. We continually assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on historical taxable income, expected taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences and the application of tax planning strategies. If we is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income or actual results differ from its other assumptions, we might be required to reduce our deferred tax assets or to increase our deferred tax liabilities, which will increase our effective tax rate, and negatively affect our operations. 73 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets: We follow the guidance in IAS 39 to determine when an available-for-sale financial asset is impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost as well as the financial position of and short-term business outlook of the issuer of the instrument, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology and operating and financing cash flows. Fair value of derivative and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. We use our judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. We have used discounted cash flow analysis for various derivative financial assets that are not traded in active markets. Changes in assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these financial instruments. Recently issued accounting pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see note 2bb to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources and Uses of Cash Sources. Our principal source of liquidity is the cash generated by our operations. Both Blue Square and its significant subsidiaries have generally generated sufficient cash from their operations to satisfy their respective operating requirements. The available cash resources of BSIP, BSRE, Bee Group and their subsidiaries have historically been used, and are expected to continue to be used, to finance the expansion of these companies. Cash generated by operations was approximately NIS 410 million in 2008, an increase of 18% compared with approximately NIS 348 million in 2007. This increase in cash generated by operations in 2008 was mainly due to the growth in sales in 2008 and the increase in cash flow from operating activities derived principally from the change from positive working capital in 2007 to negative working capital in 2008. In 2008, approximately 34% of our supermarket sales were paid for with cash, checks and gift certificates issued by the Company at the point-of-sale, approximately 63% of supermarket sales were paid for with credit cards and approximately 3.0% of supermarket sales were paid for with other short-term credit arrangements. 74 During 2008, the average time period that we held inventory was 32.4 days and the average time period within which our accounts receivable were paid was 32.1 days. By contrast, as of such date the average time period for payment of our accounts payable was 58.7 days. Accordingly, increased capital resources are not required to support an increase in our receivables or inventories because we generally sell our products before we pay our suppliers. Other sources of liquidity are long-term and short-term borrowing from banks. During 2008, we received from banks and other financial institutions long-term borrowings of NIS 231 million, or $60.9 million and short-term borrowings, net, of NIS 16 million, or $4.1 million, and during 2008, we repaid long-term borrowings in the amount of NIS 131 million, or $34.3 million and interest in the amount of NIS 89 million, or $23.5 million. In August 2006, BSRE completed its initial public offering of ordinary shares, unsecured convertible (Series A) and non-convertible (Series B) debentures on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. BSRE received net proceeds of approximately NIS 147.6 million in consideration for its ordinary shares and net proceeds of approximately NIS 731.2 million in consideration for the debentures. The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used, among other things, to repay long-term borrowings of NIS 518 million, or $122.6 million, that the Company transferred to BSRE at the time of the transfer of the real estate assets to BSRE while the Company retained the proceeds of the loan. These long-term loans were incurred by the Company as part of its preparations for the transfer of real estate assets and related financial obligations to BSRE prior to its initial public offering. In September 2008, BSRE completed the issuance of an additional NIS 125 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible (Series B) debentures. BSRE received net proceeds of approximately NIS 121.3 million or $31.9 million in consideration for the debentures. The proceeds from the issuance of the debentures were used, among other things, for investments in real estate and for working capital. The terms of these debentures are identical to the terms of the non-convertible (Series B) debentures issued by BSRE in August 2006. On May 20, 2009, the Israel Securities Authority approved the publication of a shelf prospectus that was filed by BSRE. The shelf prospectus is valid for a period of two years, and it may be used by BSRE to raise capital in the future through the issuance of shares, debentures, and/or options at the election of BSRE. The shelf prospectus does not contemplate an immediate public offering. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining principal balance (linked to the Israeli CPI) of BSRE's convertible (Series A) and non-convertible (Series B) debentures was NIS 924 million. 75 In 2003, we issued NIS 200 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.9% convertible and NIS 200 million in aggregate principal amount of nonconvertible debentures. The installments of principal on the convertible debentures are due in 2007, 2009 and 2011, and the installments of principal on the nonconvertible debentures are due in 2012, 2013 and 2014. During 2008, we did not repay any convertible debentures and none were converted into shares. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining principal balance (linked to the Israeli CPI) of the NIS 200 million convertible debentures was approximately NIS 37 million. Uses. During 2008, we repaid long-term borrowings in the amount of NIS 131 million, or $34.3 million, and interest in the amount of NIS 89 million, or $23.5 million, and we paid dividends to minority shareholders of subsidiaries in the amount of NIS 22 million or $5.8 million. We also paid a dividend to our shareholders in the aggregate amount of NIS 150 million, or $39.4 million. In recent years, we funded our renovation, remodeling and expansion programs primarily from cash generated by our operations and from long and short-term loans from banks. During 2008, we invested approximately NIS 282 million, or $74.2 million, in fixed assets and investment property, a 17% increase from our 2007 investment of NIS 241 million. Of our fixed asset investment and investment property in 2008, we invested NIS 89.5 million, or $23.7 million, in land and buildings, including land that we leased, as compared with NIS 82.7 million in 2007. We currently plan to spend in excess of NIS 145 million, or $36.6 million for the development or acquisition of new supermarkets, the renovation and remodeling of our existing supermarkets and related investments through the end of 2009. We intend to finance our store development, renovation, modeling, expansion and acquisitions mainly from cash generated by our operations and from borrowings from banks and others. In November 2008, pursuant to a cash tender offer, we completed the acquisition of the BSIP shares that were not previously held by us, for the aggregate consideration of NIS150.7 million, or $40.2 million (at that time). We currently own 100% of the shares of BSIP, and BSIP's shares are no longer traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. In September 2008, we acquired an additional 25% of the shares of Bee Group for the aggregate consideration of NIS 35.4 million, or $9.8 million (at that time), increasing our holdings in Bee Group to 85%. In October, 2007, we purchased (through Bee Group) 57.87% of the holdings of Naaman Porcelain (51.5% on a fully diluted basis) in consideration for approximately NIS 101 million or approximately $26.26 million (at that time). In March and May 2009, we purchased (through Bee Group) additional shares of Naaman, in consideration for approximately NIS 7 million, or approximately $1.8 million, following which Bee Group's holdings in Naaman were approximately 66.85% of the outstanding shares. In October, 2007, we purchased 51% of the holding of Eden Briut Teva Market Ltd. ("Eden Nature") in consideration for approximately NIS 22.5 million or approximately $5.85 million (at that time). In addition, under the agreement, (i) we provided Eden Nature with shareholder loans in the amount of NIS 47 million and (ii) we will provide all guarantees and financing required in connection with Eden Nature’s operations in the future, the repayment of existing shareholder loans in the amount of NIS 4.7 million which has since been repaid, and the payment of a bonus to Eden Nature’s CEO upon the satisfaction of various thresholds which have not yet been satisfied. 76 In April, 2007, we purchased (through Bee Group) 85.79% of the holdings of Vardinon Textile Ltd. in consideration for approximately NIS 38 million or approximately $9.88 million (at that time). Dividends The following table sets forth dividends paid by the Company from January 1, 2007 until the date of this Annual Report: Date of payment Amount per share Total amount(1) October 7, 2008 NIS 3.46 ($0.99) NIS 150 million (approximately $42.82 million) October 8, 2007 NIS 5.07 ($1.27) NIS 220 million (approximately $55 million) April 19, 2007 NIS 1.45 ($0.35) NIS 60 million (approximately $14.7 million) (1) In accordance with the representative rate of exchange of the NIS to the dollar as of the date of the payment of the dividend. In addition to the dividends described above, the following dividends were paid by the Company from 2002 to 2006: Year of payment Amount per share Total amount(1) 2006 NIS 2.81 ($0.62) NIS 110 million (approximately $24.4 million) 2005 NIS 2.29 ($0.51) NIS 89 million (approximately $20 million) 2004 NIS 6.6 ($1.48) NIS 253 million (approximately $56.7 million) 2003 NIS 7.71 ($1.72) NIS 295 million (approximately $66.1 million) 2002 NIS 3.35 ($0.72) NIS 128 million (approximately $27.3 million) (1) In accordance with the representative rate of exchange of the NIS to the dollar as of the date of the payment of the dividend. Blue Square’s board of directors has resolved that we will not distribute dividends in any quarter if the ratio of our net financial obligations (as defined by S&P-Maalot, an Israeli rating agency) to EBITDA for any quarter exceeds 3.5 until June 30, 2006 or exceeds 3.0 thereafter. Blue Square’s board of directors also resolved that Blue Square would not distribute dividends in any quarter if the ratio of the unencumbered fixed assets (following depreciation) and investment property as set forth on our financial statements to financial obligations (as defined by S&P-Maalot) for a quarter is below 120%. According to our unaudited financial reports, as of March 31, 2009, the ratio of the Company's financial obligations to EBITDA was 3.6, and the ratio of its unencumbered fixed assets to the financial obligations was 160%. Thus, the Company is currently limited in its ability to distribute dividends until the ratio of the Company's financial obligations to EBITDA returns to 3.0 or below. 77 Dividends paid by BSIP from 2004 until the date of this Annual Report: Date of payment Amount per share Total amount(1), (2) October 8, 2007 NIS 6.1 ($1.52) NIS 200 million (approximately $50 million) April 12, 2007 NIS 0.76 ($0.19) NIS 25 million (approximately $5.9 million) April 11, 2005 NIS 2.44 ($0.56) NIS 80 million (approximately $18.6 million)(3) May 30, 2004 NIS 12.21 ($2.68) NIS 400 million (approximately $87.8 million) (1) In accordance with the representative rate of exchange of the NIS to the dollar as of the date of the payment of the dividend. (2) Blue Square's share in the distribution of the dividends was approximately 80%. (3) The dividend distribution required a court approval (which was granted on March 6, 2005) because the distribution did not meet the “profit test” under the Israeli Companies Law. The distribution was made from capital gains that were originally classified as a capital reserve that originated from a transaction in 1998 with a former controlling shareholder. Due to this transaction, the Company reclassified its share in this capital gain in the amount of NIS 44.9 million from a capital reserve (within additional paid in capital) to retained earnings. Dividends paid by BSRE until the date of this Annual Report: In August 2006, the board of directors of BSRE adopted a policy that BSRE will distribute dividends in each of years 2006 to 2008 in the amount of no less than 25% of the net profits of BSRE in such year. In November 2008, BSRE's board of directors approved a decision to extend this policy for the years 2009 and 2010. Such distributions are subject to the “profit test” under the Israeli Companies Law at the relevant dates and to other decisions of BSRE board of directors, including decisions designating a different use of BSRE's profits and/or a change in the BSRE dividend policy.

Debentures The following table summarizes outstanding debentures in 2007 and 2008 of the Company and of our subsidiary, BSRE, of which we owned 78.45% of the shares as of June 15, 2009: 79 December 31 2007 2008 NIS in thousands Convertible debentures: Issued by the Company 77,295 44,267 Issued by BSRE 109,342 112,086 186,637 156,353 Less - current maturities - 25,956 186,637 130,397 Other debentures: Issued by the Company 185,769 199,585 Issued by BSRE 633,108 786,259 818,877 985,844 Less - current maturities 69,859 - 749,018 985,844 In addition, Naaman, our subsidiary through Bee Group, has outstanding convertible debentures, which as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, had a principal balance of NIS 6.2 million and NIS 171,000, respectively. Blue Square Debentures In August 2003, we issued to institutional investors NIS 400 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.9% debentures, half of which (Series B) are currently convertible into our ordinary shares. All the debentures are linked (principal and interest) to the Israeli CPI, but in the event the Israeli CPI is less than the base index (index known at date of issuance), the amount of the debentures will not be adjusted below the base index. Blue Square Series A Debentures The principal of the Series A Debentures is repayable in three equal annual installments on August 5 of each of the years 2012 to 2014, and the interest is payable semiannually. Notwithstanding the above, under the terms of the Debentures, on August 5 of each of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010, the holders of the Series A Debentures were entitled to early redemption of the principal provided that on each of such dates we do not repay more than one third of the par value of the Series A Debentures outstanding as of that date. No Series A Debentures have been redeemed to date. 80 Blue Square Series B Debentures The principal of the Series B Debentures is repayable in three equal annual installments on August 5 of each of the years 2007, 2009 and 2011, and the interest is payable semiannually. The Series B Debentures are convertible into our ordinary shares at a conversion ratio that is subject to adjustment in the event of distribution of bonus shares and cash dividends and the issuance of rights. As of June 15, 2009, each NIS 20.095 par value of debentures was convertible to one ordinary share of 1 NIS par value. This conversion ratio is after adjustment for cash dividends distributed from the date of issuance of the Series B Debentures until June 15, 2009. As of June 15, 2009, the remaining principal balance of the Series B Debentures was approximately NIS 33.5 million. Other terms of the Blue Square Series A and Series B Debentures The terms of the debentures (Series A and Series B) provide that in the event that our ordinary shares are delisted from trading on the TASE, and/or in the event that our ordinary shares are no longer held by the public and/or in the event that S&P-Maalot reduces our rating to BBB or lower, then within three months from one of the abovementioned events we, subject to the then prevailing law, will offer to acquire the debentures at a price equivalent to the price of debentures of the same type reflecting a return of 2.5% in excess of the return on Israeli Government debentures with an average life similar to the remaining average life of the debentures of that series as of the date of the offer, but in no event will the price exceed the adjusted carrying value of the debentures of that series. In May 2009, S&P-Maalot downgraded the rating of our debentures (Series A and Series B) from "ilAA" to "ilA+/Stable". According to S&P-Maalot, the downgrade reflects the erosion of our financial position during 2008, as evidenced by our increased debt coverage ratios, high leverage, lower profitability, and the deterioration in our market share throughout the year, which deterioration has been partially mitigated in 2009. These negative factors are somewhat offset by our strong liquidity, number two position in Israel's retail sector, and diversified activities. S&P-Maalot's outlook of company is stable and reflects S&P-Maalot's belief that we are taking measures, and will continue to take measures, to stop the erosion of our market share, improve our financial ratios, and avoid massive investments that can negatively affect our financial profile and leverage. BSRE Debentures In August 2006, BRSE issued 2,500,000 BRSE ordinary shares of NIS 1 par value each, together with NIS 100,000,000 par value of registered BRSE Series A debentures, which are convertible into BRSE ordinary shares, and NIS 650,000,000 par value of registered BRSE Series B debentures. In September 2008, BSRE completed the issuance of an additional NIS 125 million in principal amount of unsecured non-convertible (Series B) debentures to institutional investors. The terms of these debentures are identical to the terms of the non-convertible (Series B) debentures issued by BSRE in August 2006. 81 BSRE Series A Debentures The BSRE Series A debentures are to be redeemed in four equal annual installments on August 31 of each of the years 2013 to 2016. The Series A debentures are linked (principal and interest) to the known Israeli CPI and bear interest at an annual rate of 6.25%, which is payable semiannually. The Series A debentures are convertible into BSRE ordinary shares from the date that they are first listed for trade on the stock exchange through August 16, 2016, except during the periods from August 17 through August 31 in each of the years 2013 to 2015. The conversion rate is subject to adjustments in the event of distribution of cash dividends. Until August 31, 2008, the conversion was effected at the rate of NIS 96.83 par value of registered Series A debentures (following adjustments due to distributions of cash dividends) for each ordinary share of NIS 1 par value; since that date and through August 16, 2016, the conversion rate is NIS 281.83 par value of registered Series A debentures (following adjustments due to distributions of cash dividends) for each ordinary share of NIS 1 par value. BSRE Series B Debentures The BSRE Series B debentures are to be redeemed in four equal annual installments on August 31 of each of the years 2013 to 2016. The Series B debentures are linked to the known CPI and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.7%, which is payable semiannually. If, at the time of making any redemption/payment on account of the principal and of interest of the Series A or Series B debentures, it is found that the payment index is less than the base index (the CPI for July 2006), BSRE is required to make such payment according to the base index. For additional information on charges pertaining to the collateralized long-term loans, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. On July 27, 2006, S&P-Maalot rated the BSRE debentures (Series A and Series B) at "ilAA-", and on March 20, 2008, S&P-Maalot confirmed this rating. On September 28, 2008, S&P-Maalot rated the BSRE debentures (Series B), with an increased principal amount of up to NIS 250 million, at "ilAA-/Stable". On May 27, 2009, following the recent downgrading of the rating of our own debentures (Series A and Series B) to "ilA+/Stable", S&P-Maalot informed BSRE that it had placed BSRE's debentures (Series A and Series B) on "credit watch negative". S&P-Maalot estimates that there is a significant correlation between the rating of our debentures and the rating of BSRE's debentures due to our significant holdings in BSRE (80% at the time of the S&P-Maalot notice) and due to the fact that we are a major lessee of BSRE's properties (our lease payments to BSRE generated approximately 85% of BSRE's net operating income in 2008). S&P-Maalot informed BSRE that it will examine the effects of the downgrading of the rating of our debentures on BSRE and will publish its conclusions in the next few months. 82 Commitments for Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2008, we had entered into agreements for investments in fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements in the total amount of approximately NIS 36 million, or $9.4 million. We intend to finance these investments from cash generated by our operations and from loans from banks or other financial institutions. C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses. Not applicable. D. Trend Information. Based on A.C. Nielsen and on data published by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics of the retail sales of food, drinks and tobacco in Israel, we estimate that approximately 37% of the total retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco in Israel in 2008 was made by the two large chains and approximately 46% of the estimated retail sales made by supermarkets, groceries and mini-markets in Israel in 2008 was made by the two large chains - a percentage that is considerably lower than the estimated market shares prevailing in Europe and the United States. Accordingly, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to grow correspondingly with the general growth of the supermarket sector in Israel. In addition, we believe that we have an opportunity to grow in locations where we do not have a strong presence and in particular in the northern part of the country and in the Jerusalem area. The food retailing industry has been subject to increased competition in recent years. Since the 2005 merger between Shufersal and ClubMarket, another major chain, we have faced a larger competitor, many of whose stores are characterized by the every day sale of products at low prices. Based on A.C. Nielsen, we estimate that Shufersal's market share was approximately 36.9% of the bar-coded market in Israel in 2008, as opposed to our own approximately 21.4% share of the bar-coded market in 2008. In addition, as a result of consumers’ focus on the price of products, in recent years we and our competitors have established or expanded low-price and hard discount store formats. In 2008, very low-priced smaller supermarket chains continued to increase their market share and expand their presence in selected areas in Israel, often geographically beyond their original location. The increased competition has led to increased downward pressure on prices. 83 We expect the economic slowdown in Israel to adversely affect our financial performance, among other things, by reducing our sales and our profitability. In addition, the current global economic crisis and the resulting slowdown in the Israeli economy has impacted the food retail market by affecting the buying patterns of our customers, as more customers are shifting their purchases to low-price and hard discount stores, which have a lower profit margin. In response to these trends, in August 2007, we launched our Mega In Town store format to offer discount prices in neighborhood stores. In addition, in December 2008 we launched our Mega Bool heavy discount store format as well as our "Mega" line of private label goods that are sold in our "Mega Bool", "Mega In Town" and "Mega" stores. We expect to continue to expand our low-price and hard discount store formats in 2009 in an effort to increase our market share. In addition, during 2009, we plan on launching a new membership card and have launched a new "You" Mastercard credit card as part of our "You" loyalty club, which is designed to increase consumer traffic and encourage customers to patronage our stores. In the past few years, we have witnessed a global trend of supermarkets specializing in organic and health products. In response to this trend, we purchased Eden Nature in October 2007, which operates a leading supermarket chain in Israel offering organic/health products. In 2008, we expanded the Eden Nature chain and it now includes seven stores. We expect the Eden Nature chain to reach ten stores by the end of 2009. In order to compete effectively in the food retailing market, we believe we must identify new store locations and opportunities to expand and improve existing store locations. However, sales in new stores or in expanded or improved existing stores may increase at the expense of sales in other existing stores of ours due to geographical proximity. As the supermarket industry grows, the likelihood that sales of one store will adversely affect the sales of a nearby store increases. In 2008, we opened 10 new stores and closed one store to compete in selective areas in which we did not believe we had sufficient market presence, and we converted one Mega In Town store into Shefa Shuk and six Shefa Shuk stores into Mega In Town stores. We also converted 40 "Mega" and "Shefa Shuk" stores to the new brand “Mega Bool”. In addition, we plan to continue to remodel some of our supermarkets to give them a more “upscale” orientation, offering improved product selection and increased focus on customer service. In 2009, we plan to open approximately 14 additional supermarkets, totaling approximately 17,000 square meters of store space, in localities whose populations are currently under-served by supermarkets or in localities in which we do not have sufficient market presence. In addition, in 2009, we plan to convert approximately four "Shefa Shuk" supermarkets stores into "Mega Bool" stores. In 2009, until May 31, 2009, we opened six supermarket stores. In 2009, we are taking action to further increase our market share of “Non-Food” and “Near-Food” products and to offer a wider selection of these products to consumers in our stores with the goal of increasing the portion of our customers’ overall shopping needs that are addressed in our stores. In addition, we intend to continue our expansion into the stand alone Non Food stores market by opening approximately nine additional self-operating stores and seven additional stores operated by franchisees and to capitalize on potential synergies and an internal reorganization in order to improve our operating efficiency. 84 In 2009, in order to improve our market share, we are looking to further broaden the variety of products offered under our private label and to improve our distribution capabilities by investing in two new distribution centers. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. None. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements: Expected Maturity (NIS in thousands) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 and thereafter Total Long term loans frombanks (1) 132,913 97,832 79,791 61,295 44,269 58,399 474,499 Debentures issued bythe Company (2) (3) - 73,089 - 48,725 48,726 48,726 219,266 Convertible Debenturesissued by the Company (2) (4) 18,311 - 18,311 - - - 36,622 Non-ConvertibleDebentures issued by BSRE (5) (6) - - - - 204,570 613,710 818,280 ConvertibleDebentures issued by BSRE (5) (6) - - - - 26,396 79,189 105,585 Non-cancelable Long termleases 171,055 170,293 151,656 140,542 110,045 286,886 1,030,477 Total contractual cashobligations 322,279 341,214 249,758 250,562 434,006 1,520,916 2,684,729 (1) The table above does not include payments of interest on our long-term loans because the actual interest payments on most of the loans are dependent on variable parameters, such as changes in the Israeli CPI, or variable interest rates which cannot be predicted at the date of this report. Without taking into account any changes in the Israeli CPI or changes in foreign currency rates and assuming the relevant variable interest rate will remain at its level as it was as of December 31, 2008 (5.3% per annum), interest payments on the long-term loans (in thousands) would be NIS 25,483 in 2009, NIS 18,534 in 2010, NIS 13,598 in 2011, NIS 9,226 in 2012, NIS 5,763 in 2013, and NIS 9,711 in 2014 and beyond. (2) These debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 5.9% and are linked (principal and interest) to the Israeli CPI, but in the event the Israeli CPI is less than the base index (index known at date of issuance), the amount of debentures will not be adjusted below the base index. Without taking into account any changes to the Israeli CPI, interest payments on the Non-Convertible Debentures (in thousands) would be NIS 12,941 in 2009, NIS 12,941 in 2010, NIS 8,627 in 2011, NIS 8,627 in 2012, NIS 5,752 in 2013, and NIS 2,876 in 2014 and beyond. Without taking into account any changes to the Israeli CPI, based on the principal amount of the Convertible Debentures as of December 31, 2008 and assuming no additional conversion of debentures, interest payments on the Convertible Debentures (in thousands) would be NIS 2,165 in 2009, NIS 1,082 in 2010 and NIS 1,082 in 2011. The table above does not include payments of interest on our debentures because the actual interest payments on these debentures will depend on changes in the Israeli CPI, which cannot be predicted at the time of this report. 85 (3) The principal is repayable in three equal annual installments on August 5 of each of the years 2012 to 2014. Notwithstanding the above, under the terms of the debentures, on August 5 of each of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010, the holders of the debentures are entitled to early redemption of the principal provided that on each of the said dates, we will not repay more than one third of the par value of the debentures outstanding as of that date. The table above assumes early redemption of these debentures. (4) Under the terms of these debentures, the principal is repayable in three equal installments on August 5 of each of the years 2007, 2009, and 2011. (5) The Non-Convertible Debentures and the Convertible Debentures bear interest at an annual rate of 4.7% and 6.25%, respectively, and are linked (principal and interest) to the Israeli CPI, but in the event the Israeli CPI is less than the base index (index known at date of issuance), the amount of debentures will not be adjusted below the base index. Without taking into account any changes to the Israeli CPI, interest payments on the Non-Convertible Debentures (in thousands) would be NIS 38,459 in each of the years 2009 to 2013, NIS 28,844 in 2014, NIS 19,230 in 2015, and NIS 9,641 in 2016. Without taking into account any changes to the Israeli CPI, based on the principal amount of the Convertible Debentures as of December 31, 2008 and assuming no additional conversion of debentures, interest payments on the Convertible Debentures (in thousands) would be NIS 6,599 in each of the years 2009 to 2013, NIS 4,949 in 2014, NIS 3,300 in 2015, and NIS 1,654 in 2016. The table above does not include payments of interest on our debentures because the actual interest payments on these debentures will depend on changes in the Israeli CPI, which cannot be predicted at the time of this report. (6) The principal is repayable in four equal annual installments on August 31 of each of the years 2013 to 2016. * The table above does not include severance payment obligations because the actual severance payments will depend on the dates of payment, which cannot be predicted at the time of this report. ** The table above does not include a provision for uncertain tax positions in the amount of NIS 3.9 million. 86 ITEM 6.

So long as Alon Retail continues to own beneficially more than 50% of our outstanding ordinary shares and voting power, it will be able to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval that do not require a special majority, including the election of all Blue Square directors, other than Blue Square's two external directors whose election, under the Israeli companies law, requires that at least one-third of the non-controlling shareholders who participate in the vote, vote for their nomination, or that the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders voted against their nomination does not exceed one percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company. B. Compensation. The following table sets forth the aggregate compensation we paid or accrued on behalf of all persons who served as Blue Square directors or senior management for services they rendered Blue Square and its subsidiaries, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The table also includes compensation to individuals who ceased to serve as directors or executive officers during the year. Salaries, fees, expenses, directors’ fees, commissions and bonuses Pension, retirement and similar benefits All directors, senior management and Acting Chairman as a group $ 5,480,273 (NIS 20,836,000) $ 389,268 (NIS 1,480,000) In addition, we recorded the sum of approximately NIS 4.1 million, or $1.1 million, in 2008 as a compensation cost related to the options granted to our senior management under our share option plan. From January until April 2008, we agreed to pay to each director (including our external directors) other than the Chairman of the board of directors, the sum of NIS 45,415 per year and a meeting attendance fee of NIS 1,747, which amounts were equivalent to the amounts allowed to be paid to external directors of companies of comparable size under the second and third supplements to the Companies Regulations. Following an amendment to the Companies Regulations, in April 2008, we agreed to pay to each director (including our external directors and expert external directors) other than the Chairman of the board of directors, the sum of NIS 97,500 per year and a meeting attendance fee of NIS 3,660, which amounts are equivalent to the amounts allowed to be paid to external directors of companies of comparable size under the second, third and fourth supplements to the Companies Regulations. The fees referred to above will be adjusted from time to time based on changes to the Israeli Consumer Price Index in the same manner as the fees described in the Regulations are adjusted. The directors would also be entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in connection with their service as directors. 92 We also agreed to pay David Wiessman, our Executive Chairman of the board of directors, a monthly payment of NIS 42,497 plus VAT commencing from November 15, 2005, the date Mr. Wiessman became Executive Chairman of the board of directors. The compensation is linked to changes in Israel’s CPI since November 2005, and is updated every three months. No additional fees would be paid to Mr. Wiessman for attending meetings of the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors. Mr. Wiessman is also entitled to reimbursement of actual expenses (upon submission of receipts) incurred by him in connection with his service as Executive Chairman of the board of directors. Our audit committee, board of directors and shareholders meeting approved this arrangement. BSRE paid to its CEO, Mr. Zeev Stein, for the year 2008 a total payment which cost BSRE approximately NIS 1,523,000 (including an annual bonus). Under his employment agreement, Mr. Stein is entitled to a salary and customary fringe benefits, including a car lease and social benefits. In addition, Mr. Stein is entitled to severance compensation in excess of that which is required under law (200% of required severance in the case of dismissal and 175% of required severance in case of voluntary termination by Mr. Stein). In March 2008, the Company granted 2,200,000 options to executive officers with an exercise price of NIS 39.06 (unlinked) per share, in May 2008, the Company granted 140,000 options to executive officers with an exercise price of NIS 39.06 (unlinked) per share, and in August 2008, the Company granted 100,000 options to managers with an exercise price of NIS 39.06 (unlinked) per share. The vesting periods for the options are 66.7% at the end of two years from the date of grant and the remaining 33.3% at the end of three years from the date of grant. The options issued to executive officers and managers may be exercised during the six month period from the end of the vesting period, and options not exercised during this period will expire. C. Board Practices Appointment of Directors and Terms of Officers Our directors, other than our external directors, are elected by our shareholders at an annual general shareholders’ meeting and hold office until the next annual general shareholders’ meeting which is required to be held at least once in every calendar year, but not more than fifteen months after the last preceding annual general shareholders’ meeting. Until the next annual general shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors or shareholders may elect new directors to fill vacancies on, or increase the number of, members of the board of directors in a special meeting of the shareholders. Our board of directors may appoint any other person as a director. Any director so appointed may hold office until the first general shareholders’ meeting convened after the appointment and may be re-elected. 93 Pursuant to a recent amendment to the Israeli Companies Law, 1999, one may not be elected and may not serve as a director in a public company if he or she does not have the required qualifications and the ability to dedicate an appropriate amount of time for the performance of his duties as a director in the company, taking into consideration, among other things, the special needs and size of the company. In addition, a public company may convene an annual general meeting of shareholders to elect a director, and may elect such director, only if prior to such shareholders meeting, the nominee declares, among other things, that he possess all of the required qualifications to serve as a director (and lists such qualifications in such declaration) and that he has the ability to dedicate an appropriate amount of time for the performance of his duties as a director of the company. The above requirements do not apply to directors appointed prior to September 29, 2008. The terms of office of the directors must be approved, under the Israeli Companies Law, by the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders meeting. The appointment and terms of office of all our officers, other than directors and the general manager (Chief Executive Officer), are determined by the general manager, subject to the approval of our board of directors, audit committee and/or compensation committee. We and our subsidiaries have no service contract with any of our directors that provide for benefits upon termination of their employment as directors. Substitute Directors Our Articles of Association provide that any director may appoint another person to serve as a substitute director and may cancel such appointment. The identity of a substitute director requires the approval of the board of directors. Under the Israeli Companies Law, a person who is not himself qualified to be appointed as a director, a person who is already serving as a director or a person who is already serving as a substitute director for another director, may not be appointed as a substitute director. Nevertheless, a director who is already serving as a director may be appointed as a substitute director for a committee of the board of directors so long as (s)he is not already serving as a member of such committee, and if the substitute director is to replace an external director, (s)he is required to qualify as an external director and to have either “financial and accounting expertise” or “professional expertise”, depending on the qualifications of the external director (s)he is replacing. Otherwise, a substitute director cannot be appointed as an external director. The term of appointment of a substitute director may be for one meeting of the board of directors or until notice is given of the cancellation of the appointment. To our knowledge, no director currently intends to appoint any other person as a substitute director, except if the director is unable to attend a meeting of the board of directors. 94 Independent and External Directors Israeli Companies Law Requirements We are subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, which became effective on February 1, 2000. The Minister of Justice has adopted regulations exempting companies, like Blue Square, whose shares are traded outside of Israel, from some provisions of the Israeli Companies Law. Under the Israeli Companies Law, companies incorporated under the laws of Israel whose shares are either (i) listed for trading on a stock exchange or (ii) have been offered to the public in or outside of Israel, and are held by the public (Public Company) are required to appoint at least two external directors. The Israeli Companies Law provides that a person may not be appointed as an external director if the person or the person’s relative, partner, employer, someone to whom he is subordinated or any entity under the person’s control, has, as of the date of the person’s appointment to serve as external director, or had, during the two years preceding that date, any affiliation with us, any entity controlling us or any entity controlled by or under common control with us. The term “affiliation” includes: · an employment relationship; · a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis; · control; and · service as an office holder, other than service as a director who was appointed in order to serve as an external director of a company when such company was about to make an initial public offering. Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law, effective as of November 2006, provide for various instances and kinds of relationships in which an external director will not be deemed to have “affiliation” with the public company for which (s)he serves, or is a candidate for serving as an external director. No person can serve as an external director if the person’s position or other business create, or may create, conflict of interests with the person’s responsibilities as an external director or may impair his ability to serve as a director. Until the lapse of two years from termination of office, a company may not engage an external director to serve as an office holder and cannot employ or receive services from that person, either directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person. Under an amendment to the Companies Law, at least one of the external directors is required to have “financial and accounting expertise” and the other external director(s) are required to have “professional expertise”. Under regulations, a director having financial and accounting expertise is a person who, due to his or her education, experience and qualifications is highly skilled in respect of, and understands, business-accounting matters and financial reports in a manner that enables him or her to understand in depth the company’s financial statements and to stimulate discussion regarding the manner in which the financial data is presented. Under the regulations, a director having professional competence is a person who has an academic degree in either economics, business administration, accounting, law or public administration or an academic degree in an area relevant to the main business sector of the company or in a relevant area for the board position, or has at least five years experience in a senior management position in the business of a corporation with a substantial scope of business, in a senior position in the public service or a senior position in the field of the company’s business. 95 Under the amendment each Israeli public company is required to determine the minimum number of directors with “accounting and financial expertise” that such company believes is appropriate in light of the company’s size, the scope and complexity of its activities and other factors. Once a company has made this determination, it must ensure that the necessary appointments to the board are made in accordance with this determination. Our board of directors determined that two directors with “accounting and financial expertise” is appropriate for the Company. Our board of directors currently has at least two directors with such “accounting and financial expertise”. External directors are to be elected by a majority vote at a shareholders’ meeting, provided that either (1) the majority of shares voted at the meeting, including at least one-third of the shares of non-controlling shareholders (as defined in the Israeli Companies Law) voted at the meeting, vote in favor of the election of the director without taking abstentions into account; or (2) the total number of shares of non-controlling shareholders voted against the election of the external director does not exceed one percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company. The initial term of an external director is three years and may be extended for one additional three-year term. Nevertheless, Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law provide that companies, like Blue Square (whose shares are listed for trading both on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange), may appoint an external director for additional three-year terms, under certain circumstances and conditions. External directors may be removed only in a general meeting, by the same percentage of shareholders as is required for their election, or by a court, and in both cases only if the external directors cease to meet the statutory qualifications for their appointment or if they violate their duty of loyalty to us. Each committee of our board of directors is required to include at least one external director and our audit committee is required to include all of the external directors. David Alphandary and Uzi Baram currently serve as Blue Square's external directors. New York Stock Exchange Requirements See below “- Audit Committees - New York Stock Exchange Requirements” for a description of the independence requirements for audit committee members under applicable NYSE rules. 96 Audit Committees Israeli Companies Law Requirements Under the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an audit committee, comprised of at least three directors including all of the external directors, but excluding a: · chairman of the board of directors; · controlling shareholder or his relative; and · any director employed by or who provides services to the company on a regular basis. The role of the audit committee is to examine flaws in the business management of ours, in consultation with the internal auditor and our independent accountants and suggest appropriate course of action in order to correct such flaws. In addition, the approval of the audit committee is required to effect specified actions and transactions with interested parties. An interested party is defined in the Israeli Companies Law as a 5% or greater shareholder, any person or entity who has the right to designate one director or more or the general manager of ours or any person who serves as a director or as a general manager. An audit committee may not approve an action or a transaction with an interested party (including officers) unless at the time of approval the two external directors are serving as members of the audit committee and at least one of whom was present at the meeting in which an approval was granted. New York Stock Exchange Requirements Under New York Stock Exchange rules, Blue Square is required to maintain an audit committee consisting only of independent directors. The independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the 1934 Act implement two basic criteria for determining independence: (i) audit committee members are barred from accepting any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, other than in the member's capacity as a member of the board of directors and any board committee, and (ii) audit committee members may not be an "affiliated person" of the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer apart from his or her capacity as a member of the board and any board committee. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined "affiliate" for non-investment companies as "a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified." The term "control" is intended to be consistent with the other definitions of this term under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as "the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise." A safe harbor has been adopted by the SEC, under which a person who is not an executive officer, director or 10% shareholder of the issuer would be deemed not to have control of the issuer. The SEC has also provided certain limited exceptions for an audit committee member, who also sits on the board of directors of an affiliate to a listed issuer, so long as, except for being a director on such board of directors, the audit committee member otherwise meets the independence requirements for each entity. 97 The role of the audit committee for New York Stock Exchange purposes includes assisting the board of directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and reporting practices of Blue Square. Corporate Governance Practices Internal Auditor Under the Israeli Companies Law, the board of directors must also appoint an internal auditor proposed by the audit committee. The role of the internal auditor is to examine whether our actions comply with the law, integrity and orderly business procedure. Under the Israeli Companies Law, the internal auditor may not be an interested party, an office holder, or a relative of an interested party, or an office holder, nor may the internal auditor be our independent accountant or its representative. We comply with this requirement. Mr. Gershon Lewinsky serves as our internal auditor. Duties of Office Holders and Approval of Specified Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law Fiduciary Duties of Office Holders The Israeli Companies Law imposes a duty of care and a duty of loyalty on all office holders of a company, including directors and executive officers. The duty of care requires an office holder to act with the level of care, which a reasonable office holder in the same position would have acted under the same circumstances. The duty of care includes a duty to use reasonable means to obtain: · information on the appropriateness of a given action brought for his approval or performed by him by virtue of his position; and · all other important information pertaining to the previous actions. The duty of loyalty of an office holder includes a duty to: · refrain from any conflict of interest between the performance of his duties in the company and his personal affairs; 98 · refrain from any activity that is competitive with the company; · refrain from usurping any business opportunity of the company to receive a personal gain for himself or others; and · disclose to the company any information or documents relating to a company’s affairs which the office holder has received due to his position as an office holder. Under the Israeli Companies Law, directors’ compensation arrangements require audit committee approval, board of directors’ approval and shareholder approval. The Israeli Companies Law requires that an office holder of a company promptly disclose any personal interest that he may have and all related material information known to him, in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by the company. A personal interest of an office holder includes an interest of a company in which the office holder is, directly or indirectly, a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general manager, or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager. In the case of an extraordinary transaction, the office holder’s duty to disclose applies also to a personal interest of the office holder’s relative. The office holder must also disclose any personal interest held by the office holder’s spouse, siblings, parents, grandparents, descendants, spouse’s descendants and the spouses of any of the foregoing. Under Israeli law, an extraordinary transaction is a transaction: · other than in the ordinary course of business; · other than on market terms; or · that is likely to have a material impact on the company’s profitability, assets or liabilities. Under the Israeli Companies Law, once an office holder complies with the above disclosure requirement, the board of directors may approve a transaction between the company and an office holder, or a third party in which an office holder has a personal interest, unless the articles of association provide otherwise. A transaction that is adverse to the company’s interest cannot be approved. If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, both the audit committee and the board of directors must approve the transaction. Under specific circumstances, shareholders approval may also be required. A director who has a personal interest in a matter, which is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee, may not be present at this meeting or vote on this matter. If the majority of the directors have a personal interest in a matter, a director who has the personal interest in this matter may be present at this meeting or vote on this matter, but the board of directors decision requires the shareholder approval. 99 Controlling Shareholder Transactions and Actions Under the Israeli Companies Law, the disclosure requirements which apply to an office holder also apply to a controlling shareholder of a public company and to a person who would become a controlling shareholder as a result of a private placement. A controlling shareholder includes a shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a public company if no other shareholder owns more than 50% of the voting rights in the company. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, including a private placement in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, and the terms of compensation of a controlling shareholder or his relative, require the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders of the company. The shareholders approval must include either: · at least one-third of the shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction and who are participating in the voting, in person, by proxy or by written ballot, at the meeting; or · The total number of shares voted against the proposal by shareholders without a personal interest does not exceed one percent (1%) of the aggregate voting rights in the Company. For information concerning the direct and indirect personal interests of certain of our office holders and principal shareholders in certain transactions with us, see “Item 7. Major Shareholders – B. Related Party Transactions.” The Israeli Companies Law requires that every shareholder that participates, either by proxy or in person, in a vote regarding a transaction with a controlling shareholder indicate whether or not that shareholder has a personal interest in the vote in question, the failure of which results in the invalidation of that shareholder’s vote. However, under Regulations, promulgated pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, certain transactions between a company and its controlling shareholder(s) (or the controlling shareholder’s relative) do not require shareholder approval. The Israeli Companies Law further provides that an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a holder of 45% of the voting rights of the company, unless there is a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights of the company or would become a holder of 25% of the voting rights unless there is another person holding 25% of the voting rights. This restriction does not apply to: (i) an acquisition of shares in a private placement, if the acquisition had been approved in a shareholders meeting under certain circumstances; (ii) an acquisition of shares from a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights, as a result of which a person would become a holder of at least 25% of the voting rights; and (iii) an acquisition of shares from a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights, as a result of which the acquirer would become a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. 100 Regulations under the Israeli Companies Law provide that the Israeli Companies Law’s tender offer rules do not apply to a company whose shares are publicly traded outside of Israel, if, pursuant to the applicable foreign securities laws or stock exchange rules, there is a restriction on the acquisition of any level of control of the company, or if the acquisition of any level of control of the company requires the purchaser to make a tender offer to the public shareholders. It is the view of the Israeli Securities Authority, that U.S. securities laws and stock exchange rules do not impose the required restriction on the acquisition of any level of control of a company, and therefore the Israeli Companies Law’s tender offer rules would apply to a company whose shares are publicly traded in the United States. The Israeli Companies Law further provides that a shareholder shall refrain from oppressing other shareholders. In addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who knows that it possesses power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any shareholder who, pursuant to the provisions of a company’s Articles of Association, has the power to appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder in the company, or has any other power over the company, is under a duty to act with fairness towards the company. Under the Companies Law, the laws that apply to a breach of a contract will generally also apply to a breach of duty of fairness. Exemption, Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Office Holder Exemption Under the Israeli Companies Law, a company may not exempt an office holder from liability with respect to a breach of his duty of loyalty, but may exempt in advance an office holder from his liability to the company, in whole or in part, with respect to a breach of his duty of care (except in connection with a distribution made by the company) if so provided in its article of association. Blue Square’s Articles of Association so provides. Following approval by our audit committee and board of directors, on June 12, 2008 our shareholders approved a resolution exempting the Company's directors and officers, including any of the Company's controlling shareholders who serve as directors or officers of the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from liability towards the Company with respect to any damage caused or that will be caused to the Company by its directors and officers as a result of a breach of their duty of care toward the Company or following a bona fide action taken by them in the connection with their position in the Company, including actions taken while serving as directors or officers in another company, in connection with their position in the Company. BSRE had previously approved a prospective (in advance) exemption to BSRE's directors and officers from liability for damage resulting from a breach of his duty of care towards BSRE in connection with actions taken in good faith in their capacity as a director and/or officer of BSRE or in their capacity as an officer of another company at the request of BSRE. 101 Office Holder Insurance The Israeli Companies Law and our Articles of Association provide that, subject to the provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, we may enter into a contract for the insurance of the liability of any of our office holders with respect to: · a breach of his duty of care to Blue Square or to another person; · a breach of his duty of loyalty to Blue Square, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume that his act would not prejudice Blue Square’s interests; · a financial liability imposed upon him in favor of another person concerning an act performed by him in his capacity as an office holder; or · a breach of any duty or any other obligation, to the extent insurance may be permitting by law. Indemnification of Office Holders The Israeli Companies Law provides that a company may indemnify an office holder for the following liabilities or expenses imposed on him as a result of an act performed in his capacity as an office holder of the company, provided the company's articles of association include the following provisions with respect to indemnification: · a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to a monetary liability imposed on him in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment (including a judgment given in a settlement or an arbitrator’s award approved by the court), so long as such indemnification is limited to types of events which, in the board of directors' opinion, are foreseeable at the time of granting the indemnity undertaking in view of the Company’s actual business, and in such amount or standard as the board of directors deems reasonable under the circumstances. Such undertaking must specify the events that, in the Board of directors’ opinion, are foreseeable in view of the company’s actual business at the time of the undertaking and the amount or the standards that the board of directors deemed reasonable at the time; · a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to reasonable litigation expenses, including counsel fees, incurred by an office holder or which he is ordered to pay by a court, in proceedings that the company institutes against him or instituted on behalf of the company or by another person, or in a criminal charge from which he was acquitted, or a criminal charge in which he was convicted for a criminal offense that does not require proof of criminal intent; · a provision authorizing the company to indemnify an Office Holder for future events with respect to reasonable litigation fees, including attorney’s fees, incurred by an office holder in consequence of an investigation or proceeding filed against him by an authority that is authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, and that resulted without filing an indictment against him and without imposing on him financial obligation in lieu of a criminal proceeding, or that resulted without filing an indictment against him but with imposing on him a financial obligation as an alternative to a criminal proceeding in respect of an offense that does not require the proof of criminal intent; and 102 · a provision authorizing the company to retroactively indemnify an Office Holder. On June 12, 2008, following approval of our audit committee and board of directors, our shareholders approved amendments to our Articles of Association pertaining to indemnification of directors and officers that reflect the provisions of the Israeli Company Law described above. Our Articles of Association provide that Blue Square may undertake to indemnify an Office Holder for obligations or expenses imposed on him as a result of an act done in his capacity as an Office Holder in Blue Square or as a result of being an Office Holder, in another company in which Blue Square holds shares or has interests, as specified above. Our Articles of Association further provide that the aggregate amount of indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) shall not exceed 25% of the shareholders’ equity of the Company, as set forth in the Company’s most recent consolidated financial statements prior to the applicable payment of indemnification. Limitations on Insurance, Exemption and Indemnification The Israeli Companies Law and our Articles of Association provide that a company may not exempt or indemnify an office holder nor enter into an insurance contract, which would provide coverage for any monetary liability incurred as a result of any of the following: · a breach by the office holder of his duty of loyalty unless the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not prejudice the company; · a breach by the office holder of his duty of care if the breach was done intentionally or recklessly (a recent change to the Israeli Companies Law clarifies that this provision does not apply if the breach was solely as a result of negligence); · any act or omission done with the intent to derive an illegal personal benefit; or · any fine imposed on the office holder. In addition, under the Israeli Companies Law, indemnification of, and procurement of insurance coverage for, our office holders must be approved by our audit committee and board of directors and, in specified circumstances, by Blue Square’s shareholders. Our audit committee, board of directors and general shareholders meeting approved in February 2001 the grant of indemnification and exemption letters to our directors and officers, including those directors and officers whose term of service ended on or after September 1, 2000. In April 2002, the general shareholders meeting approved the grant of a new letter of indemnification and exemption to the officers and directors of the company. The aggregate amount of the indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) may not exceed 25% of our shareholders’ equity (in U.S. dollars) as stated in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2000, for all persons and events. Under the indemnification and exemption letters, we agreed to indemnify these directors and officers, retroactively with respect to events occurring after February 1, 2000, the date on which the Israeli Companies Law became effective and prospectively, in connection with the following issues: 103 · The issuance of securities, including the offering of securities to the public according to a prospectus, a circular, a private offering or any other manner of security offering; · Any transaction, as defined in section 1 of the Israeli Companies Law, including a transfer, sale or purchase of assets or liabilities, including securities or the receipt of any right in any of the above, and any action related, directly or indirectly, to such transaction; · An action, including handing over information and papers, in connection with sale of our shares or assets, by the Co-Op; · The filing of a report or announcement required by the Israeli Companies Law or the Israeli Securities Law, 1968, the rules and regulations of a stock exchange in or outside Israel, or any law of any other country pertaining to these issues, and/or omission to file such a report or announcement; · Any change of reorganization of us, including any related decision, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, splitting, dividing or modifying our share capital, establishment of subsidiaries or their liquidation or sale and issuance of shares; · Oral or written statements, including the expression of an opinion or a position conveyed in good faith by an office holder, in his capacity as such, during his term of office, including statements made in meetings of the board of directors or any committee; · An action in the line of business of us in relation with the following issues: building and planning, licensing of businesses, safety in work places, environment and recycling and protection of the consumer; or · Each one of the circumstances stated above, all in connection with the office holder’s service on behalf of our subsidiaries or affiliated companies. We are obligated to indemnify a director or officer for a specific loss only if the director or officer has not been compensated for that loss from another source, including from proceeds of insurance policy. We agreed to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permissible by the Israeli Companies Law, against all amounts they may be obligated to pay as a result of a court decision or a settlement or an arbitrator’s award approved by a court decision in connection with and in the scope of their activities as directors and officers of the company and actions taken by a director or officer as an office holder of the company or its subsidiary or affiliated companies. 104 We will indemnify our directors and officers for all costs or expenses, including reasonable legal expenses, that they may incur as a result of any financial obligation borne in connection with any threatened or pending civil proceeding or criminal proceeding in which the directors and officers are acquitted or (to the extent permitted by law) in which they are convicted, provided however, that the crime for which they are convicted does not require a finding of criminal intent. We further agreed to exempt these directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Israeli Companies Law from any liability towards us with respect to any damage caused or that will be caused to the company by its directors and officers if caused or will be caused following a breach of the duty of care towards the company. The letter will not apply in respect of liability or an expense imposed in respect of an action instituted by the Co-Op and/or by the appointed management committee of the Co-Op or in respect of an action instituted by the Israeli Registrar of Cooperative Societies and/or by the State of Israel in connection with the allotment of options by us in accordance with the options allotment scheme of 1996. The letter will not include exemption or indemnification in the following cases: 1. A breach of fiduciary duty, which was acted not in good faith or that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the act would cause the company any harm; 2. A breach of the duty of care, which was committed intentionally or recklessly; 3. An act committed with the intention to realize a personal illegal profit; or 4. A fine or monetary composition imposed on him. Pursuant to resolutions adopted by our shareholders, we obtained and will continue to hold a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy. Coverage under our policy has been set at $30 million (including our subsidiaries, excluding BSRE). We have purchased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy for our directors and officers and those of our subsidiaries, which includes BSIP and its subsidiaries. The insurance policy is for a period beginning on November 30, 2008, and ending on November 30, 2009, for the maximum coverage of $30 million per claim and in the aggregate during the policy period. Our audit committee, board of directors and shareholders have approved any renewal and/or extension of the insurance policy and the purchase of any other insurance policy, provided that any such renewal, extension or purchase is for the benefit of Blue Square’s previous and/or current and/or future directors and officers and on terms substantially similar to those of the insurance policy and on condition that the premium will not increase by more than 25% in any year, as compared to the previous year. Our current insurance policies comply with these terms. 105 BSRE has obtained a separate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with a coverage of $15 million per claim and in the aggregate during the insurance policy term (beginning on December 1, 2008 and ending on November 30, 2009). On June 12, 2008, following approval of our audit committee and board of directors, our shareholders approved the grant of new indemnification letters to the Company's directors and officers (and to those who will serve as its directors and officers from time to time). The aggregate amount of the indemnification (in addition to any insurance proceeds received) may not exceed 25% of the Company's equity as set forth in the Company's most recent consolidated financial statements prior to the applicable payment of indemnification. Under the new indemnification letter, the Company undertook to indemnify its directors and officers for obligations or expenses that may be imposed on them as a result of their actions in their capacity as an office holder in the Company or as a result of actions in their capacity as an office holder or the holder of any other position in another company in which the Company holds rights or is an interested party therein (unless fulfilling the position in the other company is not in connection with their function in the Company or at its request), as permitted by the Company's Articles of Association. See above "- Indemnification of Office Holders". Under the new indemnification letter, the Company undertook to indemnify its directors and officers prospectively and retroactively with respect to following events: · Issue of securities, including, an offering of securities to the public pursuant to a prospectus, private placement, tender offer or offering of securities in any other manner; · An event connected with the making of an investment by the Company before, during and after the effecting of the investment, in the course of negotiations, contractual arrangement, signature, development and monitoring the investment, including actions performed on behalf of the Company as an officer, employee or observer in the corporation in which the investment is made; · A transaction or arrangement, including a transfer, sale or purchase of assets or liabilities, and including, goods, real estate, securities, or rights, or the giving or receiving of a right in any one of them and any action connected, directly or indirectly with such transaction, and including a tender offer of any sort and another transaction in securities which the Company has issued, whether or not the Company is a party thereto; 106 · A report or notice filed or submitted according to any law, including, an event arising from the fact of the Company being a public company or arising from the fact of its securities having been offered to the public, or arising from the fact of its securities being traded on a stock exchange, and including, a report or notice in accordance with the Companies Law - 1999 or the Securities Law - 1968, or the tax laws including regulations or directives made pursuant thereto, or in accordance with laws or provisions that apply outside of Israel or a report or notice lodged or submitted in accordance with rules, directives or instructions customarily practiced on the stock exchange in Israel or abroad and/or failure to submit such report or notice; · An act in connection with voting rights in investee companies; · An act in connection with the management of market risks. · A change in the structure of the Company or its reorganization or any resolution relating thereto, including, a merger, split, alteration of the capital of the Company, setting up of subsidiaries, winding-up or sale thereof. · Action connected directly or indirectly with employer-employee relationships in the Company and/or the commercial relations of the Company, including employees, external contractors, customers, suppliers and service providers, including negotiations, entering into and implementation of personal employment agreements or collective bargaining agreements, benefits to employees, including the issue of securities to employees. · An act in connection, directly or indirectly, with the sale of products, purchase of products, import of products, operation of branches and sites of the Company, safeguarding of public health and safety instructions and provisions. · An act in connection with the issue or non-issue of licenses and permits for the Company’s activities. · The preparation and approval of financial statements, including the approval of resolutions regarding the application of accounting standards and restatement in the financial statements. · An act in connection with a distribution, including, for a repurchase by the Company of its own securities. · The transfer of information that is required or permissible for transfer according to law between the Company and/or the other companies and interested parties in any of them. · Remarks, statements including the expression of a position or opinion made in good faith by the officer in the course of performing his function and by virtue of his function, and including in the framework of meetings of the board of directors or any of its committees. · An act or deed on matters of planning and building, work safety, the environment and recycling, public health, consumer protection. 107 Pursuant to the new indemnification letter, upon issuance of the new letter, all previous indemnification letters previously issued to each director or officer by the Company will be cancelled, effective as of the date of approval of the indemnity resolution. Notwithstanding, such revocation will not prejudice or derogate from the validity of previous indemnification letters that were issued to such director or officer by the Company, to the extent that such undertaking is valid according to law and applies to actions with respect to the period preceding the approval of the indemnity resolution, and provided that such entitlement to indemnity in respect of such liability and/or expense will only be in accordance with one of the indemnification letters. Committees Our board of directors has established a compensation committee and an audit committee. Our compensation committee, which consists of David Wiessman and Uzi Baram, administers issues relating to employee compensation for senior management. Our audit committee, which consists of David Alphandary, Uzi Baram and Avraham Meiron, examines flaws in our business management and its approval is required to effect specified actions and transactions with interested parties. The audit committee also assists the board of directors in overseeing the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing and reporting practices and in the approval of our financial statements. For more information regarding the role of our audit committee see also “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees - C. Board Practices - Audit Committees.” D. Employees. As of December 31, 2008, we employed 7,475 employees (including employees of Bee Group and Eden Nature), counting multiple employees sharing a single position as a single employee, including 3,253 temporary employees. 1,054 of our employees were employed in central management and administration and in our logistics center and 6,421 in our stores. As of December 31, 2007, we employed 7,421 employees, counting multiple employees sharing a single position as a single employee, including 3,181 temporary employees. 1,047 of our employees were employed in central management and administration and in our logistics center and 6,374 in our stores. As of December 31, 2006, we employed 6,270 employees, counting multiple employees sharing a single position as a single employee, including 3,000 temporary employees. 694 of our employees were employed in central management and administration and in our logistics center and 5,576 in our stores. 108 We are subject to labor laws and regulations in Israel. Most of our employees are subject to collective bargaining labor agreements. Under a Special Collective Bargaining Agreement, referred to as the Special Agreement, from May 1996, among the Co-Op, Blue Square, the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) (Histadrut), the National Committee of the Co-Op Union Employees and the Co-Op Union, all the Co-Op employees became employees of Blue Square. The collective bargaining agreements in effect as of that date apply to Blue Square as if Blue Square and these employees were originally parties to these agreements. Blue Square became responsible for the payment of all employee benefits that had been accrued in respect of these employees during the term of employment of these employees with the Co-Op, to the extent these benefits were recorded on the Co-Op’s records. Since 1996, we entered into new labor agreements with the Histadrut and the Co-Op union, which determines our employees wages structure, the employment conditions of new employees and a wage increase to the existing employees. During 2003, we agreed to make “good will grants” to management and employees. In August 2003, we entered into a collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut and the National Committee of the Co-Op Blue Square Employees in respect of various grants to our employees which were already paid. In addition under that agreement, we agreed (i) to pay to our permanent employees 1% of any cash dividend distributed to our shareholders, but not more than $2.5 million in the aggregate to our employees; and (ii) in any public issuance of our shares after the date of the agreement, our permanent employees will be entitled to purchase up to 10% of any such offering with a 20% discount over the minimum offering price (in the event that convertible securities will be offered, the employees will be entitled to a discount of 20% from the exercise price or the rate of conversion; in the event shares are offered to the public together with other securities, employees will be entitled to a discount of 20% only on the offering price of the shares). With respect to such a purchase by our employees of our shares in a public offering, we have agreed to make loans to our employees to enable them to pay the purchase price for the shares, and these loans are to be repaid by the employees with interest and linkage upon the sale of the shares following the expiration of the appropriate tax holding period for the shares or, if desired by the employee, until the earlier of five years from the expiration of the holding period or the end of the employee’s employment with us. In January 2005, we entered into a special collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut and the National Committee of Blue Square-Israel. Under this agreement, the parties agreed that Blue Square’s employees that started their employment on or after January 1, 2003 (excluding stores managers and their deputies and departments managers and their deputies) will be entitled to night shift compensation and to compensation for working on Saturdays nights and the nights following holidays at variable rates which are lower than the payments currently being paid. In April 2006, we entered into a special collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut and the employees' union (which amends a preceding general collective bargaining agreement adopted by the Company in 1996), regarding the rights of pregnant employees which are unable to work during their pregnancy due to medical reasons. In May 2006, we entered into a special collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut and the employees' union, effective as of January 1, 2006, regarding the increase of the contributions and deductions made by employees and by the Company to a saving fund. 109 In 2006, we reached an understanding with the employees’ representative regarding the increase in the number of employees (quota) who will be deemed to be permanent employees (tenure) and shortening of the periods required for promotion. No special written collective bargaining agreement incorporating such understanding has been signed. In July 2007, we entered into a special collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut and the employees' union regarding the transition of store managers from a collective bargaining arrangement to personal employment agreements, without prejudice their social benefits (i.e., with no less favorable social benefits stipulated under the collective bargaining arrangement). Under the agreement, these store managers will continue to be subject to the applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement which require the prior approval of the employees' union and the Histadrut before their dismissal. In the event that a store manager will be transferred to more junior position, he will once again be subject to the collective bargaining agreement, and his compensation, rights and fringe benefits will be adjusted to his level prior to the transfer to a personal employment agreement. In February 2007, we entered into a special collective bargaining arrangement with the Histadrut, the employees' union and “Meitavit” (a pension funds management company) regarding contributions and deductions made for our employees and for the provision of pension insurance. This agreement provides, among others things, for improved conditions and benefits to the insured employees. In addition, we and our employees are also subject to certain provisions of the general collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists Association) by virtue of an extension order of the Israeli Ministry of Labor. These agreements concern, among other things, the maximum length of the work day and the work week and other conditions of employment. In 2007, an extension order with respect to a general collective bargaining agreement for pension insurance was signed by the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor which require all employers in Israel to obtain pension insurance for all their employees. We entered into a special collective bargaining agreement with BSIP, the Histadrut and our employees' union, effective as of April 1, 2009 (which amends a preceding general collective bargaining agreement adopted by the Company in 1996). The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% (to the base salary only) to employees who have completed or will complete 24 months of employment with us. In addition, in light of the transfer of our retail activities to BSIP, the agreement granted us the option to transfer some or all of our employees to BSIP. In addition, in the event that we transfer any of our employees to BSIP, BSIP will become responsible for the payment of all employee benefits as well as for their rights and seniority that had been accrued in respect of these employees during the term of employment of these employees with our company, to the extent these benefits were recorded on our records. 110 Under an amendment to the Employment of Employees by Manpower Contractors Act, 1996, effective as of January 1, 2008, employees of a manpower contractor (outsourced employees) will be deemed employees of the actual employer at which they were stationed following nine months from the date they were stationed at such employer, subject to certain exceptions. Under exceptional circumstances, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor may approve the extension of this period to a period not exceeding 15 month. When a manpower contractor employee become an employee of the actual employer, the entire period of time that the manpower contractor employee was stationed at the actual employer will be taken into account for purposes of calculating his seniority for benefit and employee-related purposes. Israeli law generally requires the payment by employers of severance pay upon the retirement or death of an employee or upon termination of employment by the employer or, in some circumstances, by the employee. We currently fund ongoing severance obligations by making monthly payments to pension funds, employee accounts in a provident fund and insurance policies. In addition, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay specified amounts to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Since January 1, 1995, these amounts also include payments for national health insurance payable by employees. Most of our employees are covered by a pension fund. Our senior employees are covered by general and/or individual life and pension insurance policies providing customary benefits to employees, including retirement and severance benefits. E. Share Ownership. As of June 15, 2009, other than indirect ownership through Alon Retail, none of our directors or officers owned more than 1% of our outstanding equity securities. On January 21, 2008, we adopted a share option plan (the "Plan") for officers and employees of Blue Square and/or its subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan is five million shares (including options issuable to Blue Square's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Zeev Vurembrand), subject to adjustments. The exercise price of each option will be at the fair market value per share on the date of grant, and all exercises of options under the plan are to be on a cashless basis. Therefore, the actual number of shares to be issued under the Plan will be less than five million. As of the date of this Annual Report, an aggregate of 2,420,500 options granted to employees under the Plan were outstanding, with an exercise price of NIS 34.42 per share (adjusted for 50% of the dividends paid), and 2,040,000 options granted to executive officers and managers under the Plan were outstanding with an exercise price of NIS 37.33 per share (adjusted for 50% of the dividends paid). The vesting periods for the options granted are 66.7% at the end of two years from the date of grant and the remaining 33.3% at the end of three years from the date of grant. The options issued to executive officers and managers may be exercised during the six month period from the end of the vesting period, and options not exercised during this period will expire. The options issued to employees may be exercised during the 30 days from the end of the vesting period, and options not exercised during this period will expire. 111 The Plan expires three years from the date of first grant of options under the Plan, which was on March 24, 2008. Unless otherwise decided by the Company's Board of Directors or a committee thereof, options granted under the Plan will vest and be exercisable pursuant to the time schedule set out below on condition that the option holder will be employed by the Company, a Company subsidiary or a company controlled by the Company on the date of issuance and on the applicable vesting date. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Company Board of Directors or a committee thereof: two-thirds of the options will be exercisable at the expiration of two years from the date of grant, and one-third of the options will be exercisable at the expiration of the third year after date of grant.

(hereinafter: “Dor-Alon Stations”), operates convenience stores in fuel service stations and also in a number of cities in Israel that sell various food and “Non-Food” products. Under the terms of the agreement between us and Dor Alon Stations, we agreed to procure products that will be supplied to the convenience stores, either directly from suppliers or from our distribution center. In consideration of the procurement of products, Dor Alon Stations has agreed to pay us (i) for products sent directly from suppliers, an amount equal to the cost of such products to us as determined under the Procurement Agreement plus 2%, and (ii) for products sent from our distribution center, an amount equal to the cost of such products to us as determined under Procurement Agreement plus 2.75%, in each case plus VAT. The cost of the products to us will be audited by our independent public accountants. In the event that our revenues generated from the Procurement Agreement minus related expenses from the sale of products to Dor Alon Stations is less than NIS 1 million linked to the Israeli consumer price index in any year without VAT, Dor Alon Stations will pay us additional amounts in order that our income from such year will reach such NIS 1 million amount.

In addition, with respect to convenience stores located in Dor Alon fuel service stations that are operated by third parties, we have agreed that upon Dor Alon’s request, we may enter into separate agreements with respect to such stores with the third party operators of such stores on substantially similar terms as the Procurement Agreement described above. Dor Alon Energy In Israel (1988) Ltd. and Alon Israel Oil Company Ltd. would also guarantee the obligations of such third party operators and Dor Alon Stations, under these related separate agreements. 114 Transactions with Dor Alon in Connection with Establishment of a Joint Loyalty Plan On November 29, 2005, we entered into the following agreements with Dor Alon Energy In Israel (1988) Ltd. (“Dor Alon”): (i) an agreement establishing a joint loyalty plan for the benefit of Blue Square's and Dor Alon’s customers, formed as a partnership to be held 75% by Blue Square and 25% by Dor Alon (the “Loyalty Plan”). Pursuant to the agreement, the partnership is governed by a managers board (the “Board”), which is comprised of six (6) members, four (4) of whom appointed by the Company (one of whom serves as the chairman of the Board), and two (2) of whom are appointed by Dor Alon; (ii) an agreement under which Blue Square and Dor Alon purchased 49% of the shares of capital stock of Diners Club Israel Ltd. (“Diners Israel”) from Credit Cards for Israel Ltd. (“CAL”) for a total consideration of NIS 21.3 million (of which NIS 15.6 million was paid by us). The purchased shares were allocated 36.75% to Blue Square and 12.25% to Dor Alon. The consideration was funded through a non-recourse loan granted by CAL to the Company and Dor Alon. The loan is for a period of eight years, is linked to the CPI and bears interest in an annual rate of 6%. The loan is to be repaid in a single payment at the end of the period. Repayment of the loan is secured only by the acquired shares. Under the agreement, the Company and Dor Alon are entitled to share with CAL the net income of Diners Israel in connection with the activities of the credit cards bearing the "You" name based on their respective ownership interests in Diners Israel. The percentage of the net income of Diners Israel in connection with its other credit card activities (i.e., those activities outside the Loyalty Plan) to be allocated to the Company and Dor Alon is to be determined based on the number of "activated" credit cards (as defined in the agreement) issued to members of the Loyalty Plan from time to time, so long as certain target numbers of such issued credit cards are met. In the event such target numbers are not met, the Company and Dor Alon may, during the first three years following the issuance of the first Diners Israel credit card to a member of the Loyalty Plan (the "Issuance Date"), purchase the right to the net income of Diners Israel arising from such other activities through a one-time payment. The Company and Dor Alon may terminate the agreement by returning the purchased shares back to CAL on the fourth anniversary of the Issuance Date and canceling the CAL Loan. Under certain other circumstances, each of the Company and Dor Alon on the one hand, and CAL on the other hand, has the right to terminate the agreement. Upon such termination, the Company and Dor Alon are required to repay the CAL loan by returning the purchased shares to CAL and receive 49% of any increase in the value of Diners Israel that occurred since the Issuance Date. These circumstances include the following events: (i) if certain target numbers of issued Loyalty Plan credit cards are not met by the fourth or sixth anniversary of the Issuance Date, or (ii) the Loyalty Plan ceases to function or the customer club agreement (referred to in clause (iii) below) is terminated. In addition, the Company and Dor Alon have the option to terminate the agreement and repay the CAL Loan in kind by returning to CAL the purchased shares in the event that the representations made by Cal or Diners Israel in the agreement are breached; and 115 (iii) an agreement among Blue Square and Dor Alon, on one hand, and Diners Israel, on the other hand, pursuant to which the Loyalty Plan offers to its members a Diner Club Israel credit card bearing the name “You”. The agreement determines, among other things, the allocation of costs between the parties with respect to the costs of attracting new customers to the Loyalty Plan, mailing and advertising costs, including the participation of Diners in the advertising budget of the Loyalty Program, and clearing fees.
