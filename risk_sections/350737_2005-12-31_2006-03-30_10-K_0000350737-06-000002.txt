Item 1A. Risk factors Concentration of credit risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Our five largest customers represented approximately 43%, 55% and 55% of consolidated gross revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003; and 26% and 77% of consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2005 and 2004,respectively. We have had a longstanding relationship with each of these entities and have always collected open receivable balances. However, the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our operations. 4 As disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, our largest customer, West Marine, publicly announced their adoption of a policy to reduce their overall inventory levels. This has resulted in an approximate $4,294,000 decrease in sales to them for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. Concentration of cash - At various times of the year and at December 31, 2005, we had a concentration of cash in one bank in excess of prevailing insurance offered through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at such institution. Management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk. Operating losses at Alabama subsidiary - A major component of the losses sustained during the year ended December 31, 2005 is the operations at our manufacturing subsidiary, Kinpak Inc. Corporate management has enhanced its analysis, supervision and overall involvement with our manufacturing facility. We have identified several areas that require improvement and through increased on-site management presence, major personnel changes, adoption of certain strategic enhancements to our manufacturing process, and a renewed commitment from personnel in Alabama to strive for improved efficiency and cost savings, we believe that we will achieve a material reduction in manufacturing cost thereby improving product margins and operating profits (losses) during 2006.
