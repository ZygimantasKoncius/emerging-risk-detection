Item 1A. Risk Factors Exponent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those mentioned elsewhere in this report and the following: Absence of Backlog Revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice, and engagements, generally billed as services are performed, are terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients. As a result, backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods. Revenues and operating margins for any particular quarter are generally affected by staffing mix, resource requirements and timing and size of engagements. Attraction and Retention of Key Employees ExponentÂ’s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor-intensive. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly qualified technical and managerial personnel and to retain existing employees. The loss of key managerial employees or any significant number of employees could have a material adverse impact on our business, including our ability to secure and complete engagements. Competition The markets for our services are highly competitive. In addition, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced, and expect to continue to face, additional competition from new entrants into our markets. Competitive pressure could reduce the market acceptance of our services and result in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Customer Concentration We currently derive and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients, organizations and insurers related to the transportation industry. Transportation industry related engagements accounted for approximately 17% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2006. In addition, we performed engagements for the government sector, which accounted for approximately 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2006. The loss of any large client, organization or insurer related to either the transportation industry or government sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Economic Uncertainty The markets that we serve are cyclical and subject to general economic conditions, particularly in light of the labor-intensive nature of our business and our relatively high compensation expenses. If the economy in which we operate, which is predominately in the U.S., were to experience a prolonged slowdown, demand for our services could be reduced considerably. Professional Reputation The professional reputation of Exponent and its consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals. Any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulation Public concern over health, safety and preservation of the environment has resulted in the enactment of a broad range of environmental and/or other laws and regulations by local, state and federal lawmakers and agencies. These laws and the implementing regulations affect nearly every industry, as well as the agencies of federal, state and local governments charged with their enforcement. To the extent changes in such laws, regulations and enforcement or other factors significantly reduce the exposures of manufacturers, owners, service providers and others to liability, the demand for our services may be significantly reduced. Tort Reform Several of our practices have a significant concentration in litigation support consulting services. To the extent tort reform reduces the exposure of manufacturers, owners, service providers and others to liability, the demand for our litigation support consulting services may be significantly reduced. Variability of Quarterly Financial Results Variations in our revenues and operating results occur from time to time, as a result of a number of factors, such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a 11 Table of Contents quarter, the timing of engagements, the number of working days in a quarter, employee hiring and utilization rates, and integration of companies acquired. Because a high percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel and facilities related expenses, are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter, a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of our client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
