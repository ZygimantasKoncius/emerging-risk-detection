Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our ability to return to profitable growth is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent difficulties associated with shifting our strategic plan.In fiscal 2013, we completed the first and second phases of our turnaround strategy as we stabilized our business and rebuilt the Company, working to create strategies for reconnecting with our core customer. During fiscal 2014, we entered the “go-forward” phase of our turnaround as we position the Company for long-term growth. However, it may take longer than expected to recover from our negative sales trends and operating results, and actual results may be materially less than planned. Our ability to improve our operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•customer response to our marketing and merchandise strategies;•our ability to achieve profitable sales and to make adjustments in response to changing conditions;•our ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry;•our ability to effectively manage inventory;•the success of our omnichannel strategy;•our ability to benefit from capital improvements made to our store environment; •our ability to respond to any unanticipated changes in expected cash flows, liquidity and cash needs, including our ability to obtain any additional financing or other liquidity enhancing transactions, if and when needed;•our ability to achieve positive cash flow;•our ability to access adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise from suppliers at expected levels and on acceptable terms; and•general economic conditions.There is no assurance that our pricing, branding, store layout, marketing and merchandising strategies, or any future adjustments to our strategies, will improve our operating results.We operate in a highly competitive industry, which could adversely impact our sales and profitability.The retail industry is highly competitive, with few barriers to entry. We compete with many other local, regional and national retailers for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business. Those competitors include other department stores, discounters, home furnishing stores, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs, direct-to-consumer businesses, including those on the Internet, and other forms of retail commerce. Some competitors are larger than JCPenney, and/or have greater financial resources available to them, and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting, selling their products and updating their store environment. Competition is characterized by many factors, including merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation, credit availability and customer loyalty. We have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience for at least the foreseeable future, significant competition from our competitors. The performance of competitors as well as changes in their pricing and promotional policies, marketing activities, customer loyalty programs, new store openings, store renovations, launches of Internet websites, brand launches and other merchandise and operational strategies could cause us to have lower sales, lower gross margin and/or higher operating expenses such as marketing costs and other selling, general and administrative expenses, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our profitability.Our sales and operating results depend on our ability to develop merchandise offerings that resonate with our existing customers and help to attract new customers.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict and respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences in a timely manner by consistently offering stylish, quality merchandise assortments at competitive prices. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences. The merchandise assortment under our prior strategy did not resonate with customers so we are re-establishing brands that our customers want. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will be able to satisfy constantly changing customer demands. To the extent our predictions regarding our merchandise differ from our customers’ preferences, we may be faced with reduced sales and excess inventories for some products and/or missed opportunities for 6Table of Contentsothers. Any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and customer preferences and buying trends could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, merchandise misjudgments may adversely impact the perception or reputation of our Company, which could result in declines in customer loyalty and vendor relationship issues, and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to increase sales and store productivity is largely dependent upon our ability to increase customer traffic and conversion.Customer traffic depends upon our ability to successfully market compelling merchandise assortments as well as present an appealing shopping environment and experience to customers. Our strategies focus on increasing customer traffic and improving conversion in our stores and online; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or will result in increased sales. A substantial majority of our stores are located in malls, which have been experiencing a decline in traffic. There is no assurance that this trend will reverse or that increases in off-mall and/or Internet traffic will offset the decline. We may need to respond to any declines in customer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers to our stores, which could adversely impact our gross margins, operating results and cash flows from operating activities.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Our profitability depends upon our ability to manage appropriate inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns. We must properly execute our inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores and online, timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores, adjusting our merchandise mix between our private and exclusive brands and national brands, appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns. If we overestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we will likely need to record inventory markdowns and move the excess inventory to be sold at clearance prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. If we underestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages which may result in missed sales opportunities and have a negative impact on customer loyalty.We must protect against security breaches or other unauthorized disclosures of confidential data about our customers as well as about our employees and other third parties.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain information about our customers (including credit/debit card information), our employees and other third parties. Confidential data must at all times be protected against security breaches or other unauthorized disclosure. We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches as well as fraudulent transactions and other activities. Despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, we cannot be assured that all of our systems and processes are free from vulnerability to security breaches or inadvertent data disclosure by third parties or us. Any failure to protect confidential data about our customers or our employees or other third parties could materially damage our brand and reputation as well as result in significant expenses and disruptions to our operations, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.The failure to retain, attract and motivate our employees, including employees in key positions, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our results depend on the contributions of our employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. This depends to a great extent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate talented employees throughout the organization, many of whom, particularly in the stores, are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. As a result of restructuring activities taken during the past few years, we now operate with significantly fewer individuals who have assumed additional duties and responsibilities, which could have an adverse impact on our operating performance and efficiency. Because of our lower than expected operating results during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013, we have not generally paid bonuses, and salary increases and incentive compensation opportunities have been limited. Any prolonged inability to provide meaningful salary increases or incentive compensation opportunities, or media reports regarding our financial condition, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is also subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, competing wages and potential union organizing efforts. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role in our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business. 7Table of ContentsDisruptions in our Internet website, or our inability to successfully execute our online strategy, could have an adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.We sell merchandise over the Internet through our website, www.jcpenney.com. As a result of a significant decline in sales volume through our website in fiscal 2012, we reorganized our Internet operations in fiscal 2013. Our Internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including rapid technological change and the implementation of new systems and platforms; liability for online content; violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online privacy and intellectual property rights; credit card fraud; problems associated with the operation of our website and related support systems; computer viruses; telecommunications failures; electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and the allocation of inventory between our website and department stores. The failure of our website to perform as expected could result in disruptions and costs to our operations and make it more difficult for customers to purchase merchandise online. In addition, our inability to successfully develop and maintain the necessary technological interfaces for our customers to purchase merchandise through our website, including user friendly software applications for smart phones and tablets, could result in the loss in Internet sales and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems; disruptions in those systems or increased costs relating to their implementation could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions, generate performance and financial reports and administer payroll and benefit plans.Beginning in fiscal 2013, we have implemented several products from third party vendors to simplify our processes and reduce our use of customized existing legacy systems and expect to place additional applications into operation in the future. Implementing new systems carries substantial risk, including implementation delays, cost overruns, disruption of operations, potential loss of data or information, lower customer satisfaction resulting in lost customers or sales, inability to deliver merchandise to our stores or our customers, the potential inability to meet reporting requirements and unintentional security vulnerabilities. There can be no assurances that we will successfully launch the new systems as planned, that the new systems will perform as expected or that the new systems will be implemented without disruptions to our operations, any of which may cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, unreliable, corrupted, insufficient or inaccessible.We also outsource various information technology functions to third party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. We rely on those third party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis and their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in disruptions and costs to our operations.Our vendors are also highly dependent on the use of information technology systems. Major disruptions in their information technology systems could result in their inability to communicate with us or otherwise to process our transactions and could result in disruptions to our operations. Our vendors are responsible for having systems and processes in place to safeguard against security and data breaches involving our information and access to our information and systems. Any failure in their systems to operate or in their ability to protect our information or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our liquidity.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings, as a result of which we have experienced multiple corporate credit ratings downgrades. These downgrades, and any future downgrades, to our long-term credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of us. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, on favorable terms or at all.Our profitability depends on our ability to source merchandise and deliver it to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner.Our merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of suppliers, and our business depends on being able to find qualified suppliers and access products in a timely and efficient manner. Inflationary pressures on commodity prices and other input costs could increase our cost of goods, and an inability to pass such cost increases on to our customers or a change in our merchandise mix 8Table of Contentsas a result of such cost increases could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Additionally, the impact of current and future economic conditions on our suppliers cannot be predicted and may cause our suppliers to be unable to access financing or become insolvent and thus become unable to supply us with products.Our arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may be impacted by our financial results or financial position.Substantially all of our merchandise suppliers and vendors sell to us on open account purchase terms. There is a risk that our key suppliers and vendors could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of merchandise to us on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery or other assurances or credit support or by choosing not to sell merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all. Our arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may also be impacted by media reports regarding our financial position. Our need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply of merchandise could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position.Our senior secured term loan credit facility is secured by certain of our real property and substantially all of our personal property, and such property may be subject to foreclosure or other remedies in the event of our default. In addition, the term loan credit facility contains provisions that could restrict our operations and our ability to obtain additional financing.In May 2013, we entered into a $2.25 billion senior secured term loan credit facility that is secured by mortgages on certain real property of the Company, in addition to liens on substantially all personal property of the Company, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the credit and security agreement governing the term loan credit facility and related security documents. The real property subject to mortgages under the term loan credit facility includes our headquarters, distribution centers and certain of our stores.The credit and guaranty agreement governing the term loan credit facility contains operating restrictions which may impact our future alternatives by limiting, without lender consent, our ability to borrow additional funds, execute certain equity financings or enter into dispositions or other liquidity enhancing or strategic transactions regarding certain of our assets, including our real property. Our ability to obtain additional or other financing or to dispose of certain assets could also be negatively impacted because a substantial portion of our owned assets have been pledged as collateral for repayment of our indebtedness under the term loan credit facility.If an event of default occurs and is continuing, our outstanding obligations under the term loan credit facility could be declared immediately due and payable or the lenders could foreclose on or exercise other remedies with respect to the assets securing the term loan credit facility, including our headquarters, distribution centers and certain of our stores. If an event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations or refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.Our revolving credit facility limits our borrowing capacity to the value of certain of our assets. In addition, our revolving credit facility is secured by certain of our personal property, and lenders may exercise remedies against the collateral in the event of our default.The Company has a revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.85 billion and has borrowed $650 million as of February 1, 2014. Our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility varies according to the Company’s inventory levels, accounts receivable and credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. In the event of any material decrease in the amount of or appraised value of these assets, our borrowing capacity would similarly decrease, which could adversely impact our business and liquidity.Our revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations become applicable if our availability falls below certain thresholds. These covenants could impose significant operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. In addition, the revolving credit facility provides for a springing fixed charge coverage ratio if our availability falls below a specified threshold.Our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens with respect to inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and certain related collateral. In the event of a default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, 9Table of Contentsthe lenders’ commitment to extend further credit under our revolving credit facility could be terminated, our outstanding obligations could become immediately due and payable, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral, which generally consists of the Company’s inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts and cash credited thereto. If we are unable to borrow under our revolving credit facility, we may not have the necessary cash resources for our operations and, if any event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations, refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cash collateralize our letters of credit, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may require the use of our available cash resources to meet repayment obligations, which could reduce the cash available for other purposes.As of February 1, 2014, we have $5.601 billion in total indebtedness and we are highly leveraged. Our level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, to fund additional projects, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, and other general corporate or other obligations, as well as increase the risks to our business associated with general adverse economic and industry conditions. Our level of indebtedness may also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged.We are required to make quarterly repayments in a principal amount equal to $5.625 million during the five-year term of the term loan credit facility, subject to certain reductions for mandatory and optional prepayments.In addition, we are required to make prepayments of the term loan credit facility with the proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance proceeds and excess cash flow, which will reduce the cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures for store improvements, and could impact our ability to reinvest in other areas of our business.We cannot assure that our internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements.We must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, capital improvement plans, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our credit facilities, other debt financings, equity financings and sales of non-operating assets. We have sold a substantial amount of non-operating assets over the past two years. We expect our ability to generate cash through the sale of non-operating assets to diminish as the size of our portfolio of non-operating assets decreases. In addition, our recent operating losses have limited our capital resources. Our ability to achieve our business and cash flow plans is based on a number of assumptions which involve significant judgments and estimates of future performance, borrowing capacity and credit availability, which cannot at all times be assured. Accordingly, we cannot assure that cash flows from operations and other internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements. If necessary, we may need to consider actions and steps to improve our cash position and mitigate any potential liquidity shortfall, such as modifying our business plan, pursuing additional financing to the extent available, reducing capital expenditures, pursuing and evaluating other alternatives and opportunities to obtain additional sources of liquidity and other potential actions to reduce costs. We cannot assure that any of these actions would be successful, sufficient or available on favorable terms. Any inability to generate or obtain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our cash requirements at the level and times needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position.Our ability to obtain any additional financing or any refinancing of our debt, if needed at any time, depends upon many factors, including our existing level of indebtedness and restrictions in our debt facilities, historical business performance, financial projections, prospects and creditworthiness and external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit and capital markets. Any additional debt, equity or equity-linked financing may require modification of our existing debt agreements, which we cannot assure would be obtainable. Any additional financing or refinancing could also be extended only at higher costs and require us to satisfy more restrictive covenants, which could further limit or restrict our business and results of operations, or be dilutive to our stockholders.10Table of ContentsOperating results and cash flows may cause us to incur asset impairment charges.Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that a full recovery of net asset values through future cash flows is in question. We also assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Our impairment review requires us to make estimates and projections regarding, but not limited to, sales, operating profit and future cash flows. If our operating performance reflects a sustained decline, we may be exposed to significant asset impairment charges in future periods, which could be material to our results of operations.We are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries.A substantial portion of our merchandise is sourced by our vendors and by us outside of the United States. All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier legal compliance program and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws. Although we diversify our sourcing and production by country and supplier, the failure of a supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, or our inability to flow merchandise to our stores or through the Internet channel in the right quantities at the right time could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation.Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from abroad and purchasing product made in foreign countries, such as:•potential disruptions in manufacturing, logistics and supply;•changes in duties, tariffs, quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise;•strikes and other events affecting delivery;•consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise;•product compliance with laws and regulations of the destination country;•product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled, defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful;•concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or components are sourced, and changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries;•local business practice and political issues that may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts;•compliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business practices, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•economic, political or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is imported.Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, labor conditions, transport capacity and costs, systems issues, problems in third party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory. These risks and other factors relating to foreign trade could subject us to liability or hinder our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our results of operations.Our Company’s growth and profitability depend on the levels of consumer confidence and spending.Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Many economic factors outside of our control, including the housing market, interest rates, recession, inflation and deflation, energy costs and availability, consumer credit availability and terms, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, and unemployment trends influence consumer confidence and spending. The domestic and international political situation and actions also affect consumer confidence and spending. In particular, the moderate income consumer, which is our core customer, has been under economic pressure for the past several years, and may have less disposable income 11Table of Contentsfor items such as apparel and home goods. Additional events that could impact our performance include pandemics, terrorist threats and activities, worldwide military and domestic disturbances and conflicts, political instability and civil unrest. Declines in the level of consumer spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability.Our business is seasonal, which impacts our results of operations.Our annual earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions. This seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter.Our profitability may be impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unseasonable or unexpected weather conditions such as warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. Extreme weather or natural disasters could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise, delay capital improvements or cause us to close stores. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations could increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. The current political environment, financial reform legislation, the current high level of government intervention and activism, regulatory reform and stockholder activism may result in substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations and/or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, which may lead to additional compliance costs as well as the diversion of our management’s time and attention from strategic initiatives. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation that could disrupt our operations and increase our costs of doing business. Changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as privacy and information security, product safety or environmental protection, including regulations in response to concerns regarding climate change, collective bargaining activities and health care mandates, among others, could also cause our compliance costs to increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Legal and regulatory proceedings could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our Company is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business, certain of which may involve jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class action litigation brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. In addition, litigation risks related to claims that technologies we use infringe intellectual property rights of third parties have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose primary business is to assert such claims. Reserves are established based on our best estimates of our potential liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims are meritorious, legal and regulatory proceedings may require that we devote substantial time and expense to defend our Company. Unfavorable rulings could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets, and other factors could affect our earnings, equity, and pension contributions in future periods.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded for our qualified pension plan. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) require that income or expense for the plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions and calculations. The most significant assumptions relate to the capital markets, interest rates and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. Two critical assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the year are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. In addition, at the measurement date, we must also reflect the funded status of the plan (assets and liabilities) on the balance sheet, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly 12Table of Contentsrelated, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we could be required to contribute to the pension plan. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve a plan’s funded status.Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning us or any of our competitors, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, our financial condition, any quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts’ expectations and sales of large blocks of our common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. This volatility could affect the price at which you could sell shares of our common stock.Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities. During October 2013, four purported class action complaints and two shareholder derivative actions were filed against the Company and certain of our current and former members of the Board of Directors and executives following our announcement of an issuance of common stock on September 26, 2013. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management’s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited. The Company has a federal net operating loss (NOL) of $2.1 billion. This NOL carryforward (expiring in 2032 and 2033) is available to offset future taxable income.Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset if a corporation experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when the Company’s “five-percent shareholders” (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.If an ownership change occurs, the amount of the taxable income for any post-change year which may be offset by a pre-change loss is subject to an annual limitation that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. This limitation is derived by multiplying the fair market value of the Company stock as of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate which was 3.5% at February 1, 2014. To the extent that a company has a net unrealized built-in gain at the time of an ownership change, which is realized or deemed recognized during the five-year period following the ownership change, there is an increase in the annual limitation for each of the first five-years that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year.The Company has an ongoing study of the rolling three-year testing periods. Based upon the elections the Company currently plans to make in filing its tax return and the information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as of February 15, 2014, the Company has not had a Section 382 ownership change through February 1, 2014. If the Company were to make certain alternative elections, an ownership change could be established as occurring on September 26, 2013 when the Company’s trading value would have been approximately $2.3 billion before adjustment for the value of any control premium. Under section 382 of the Code, as of September 26, 2013 the annual NOL limitations and built-in gain adjustments that would apply through the respective NOL and credit carryforward periods would total approximately $2.3 billion, and would exceed the total of the tax loss carryforwards (including carryover credits on a loss equated basis) recognizable as of September 26, 2013. Certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and unused charitable contribution tax benefits totaling $23 million would be written-off against the valuation allowance in a September 26, 2013 ownership change scenario due to their shorter carryforward periods.Effective October 22, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service made final certain proposed regulations under Section 382. These regulations are generally more taxpayer favorable as to measuring the impact of an ownership shift and allow a corporate taxpayer to apply the new regulations to prior testing dates as long as an ownership change had not occurred under the old regulations in any testing period ending on or before October 22, 2013. The Company has revised its ongoing study of the rolling three-year testing periods so that all ownership shifts are determined under the new regulations. 13Table of ContentsAvoiding an initial ownership shift by staying under a cumulative 50 percentage point shift in the rolling three year testing periods is preferable to being subject to the Section 382 NOL limitations. If an ownership change is encountered at some point, it is generally preferable that it be at a time when the value of the company and built-in gains to be recognized are such that the Section 382 limitations are at their highest levels as compared to the loss and credit carryforwards. Losses incurred after an ownership change are not subject to limitation except where there is a new cumulative 50 percentage point change under the rolling three year testing periods. The Company plans to continue its analysis of the elections available to it in filing its federal income tax return and the impact of the new regulations.If an ownership change should occur in the future, the Company’s ability to use the NOL to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income generated by the Company in future periods. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to fully utilize the NOL and the Company could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL that may not be realized, which could impact the Company’s result of operations.We believe that these NOL carryforwards are a valuable asset for us. We have a stockholder rights plan, or the Amended Rights Agreement, in place to protect our stockholders from coercive takeover practices or takeover bids that are inconsistent with their best interests. On January 27, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the Amended Rights Agreement in an effort to protect our NOLs during the effective period of the Amended Rights Agreement. Further, on January 27, 2014, our Board of Directors adopted certain amendments to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, which are intended to preserve the Company’s NOLs by restricting certain transfers of our common stock (the Charter Amendments). The Amended Rights Agreement and the Charter Amendments will be submitted to a stockholder vote at the Company’s 2014 annual meeting of stockholders on May 16, 2014. If the Company’s stockholders do not approve the Amended Rights Agreement, it will expire. If the Company’s stockholders do not approve the Charter Amendments, they will not become effective. Although the Amended Rights Agreement and the Charter Amendments are intended to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the Amended Rights Agreement and the Charter Amendments will prevent all transfers that could result in such an “ownership change”. There also can be no assurance that the transfer restrictions in the Charter Amendments will be enforceable against all of our stockholders absent a court determination confirming such enforceability. The transfer restrictions may be subject to challenge on legal or equitable grounds. The Amended Rights Agreement and the Charter Amendments could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our Company or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Amended Rights Agreement through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. The acquisition may also be void under the Charter Amendments. The foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock. In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.
