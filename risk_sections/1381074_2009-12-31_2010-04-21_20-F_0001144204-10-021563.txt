D. Risk factors. The following matters and other additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects or otherwise. Reference to a cautionary statement in the context of a forward-looking statement or statements shall be deemed to be a statement that any one or more of the following factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statement or statements. (a) Risks Associated with Our Business Our business has been adversely affected by the global financial crisis since 2008. Although in the second half of 2009, the world economy showed signs of has been gradually recovery, in 2009 the Company’s operation were still adversely affected which due primarily to the deline of the market demand and sales price, and decrease of exports, and so on. If the economy does not continue to recover, our operation will continue to face such declines again. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, our business has been significantly affected by the global financial crisis. The domestic market has experienced a drop in demand for our products, especially in the volume of high value-added special films, and our sales export markets declined significantly. Despite the remedial measures taken by the Company in 2009, such as reducing costs and decreasing expenses in order to strengthen our profitability and lessen the adverse effect on our business caused by the financial crisis, the Company continued to suffer the adverse effect of the global financial crisis due to the competition in the market place. In the event that the global economy does not continue to recover, our operation may continue to face such declines. In addition, the financial crisis may affect our suppliers and customers. Such adverse effect on our supplies and customers may, in turn, adversely affect our business. A sharp fluctuation in the demand for raw materials may have a negative impact on our operations if we are unable to pass on all increases in cost of raw materials to our customers on a timely basis. The total cost of raw materials made up approximately76.0%, 78.6% and 73.3% of our cost of goods sold in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively. The main raw materials used in our production of BOPET film are polyethylene terephthalate (or PET) resin and additives, which respectively made up approximately 76.8% and 23.2% of our total cost of raw materials in the past three years on average. 7 Currently the PET resin is mainly used as a raw material in China’s textile industry. The market prices of PET resin may fluctuate due to changes in supply and demand conditions in that industry. Any sudden shortage of supply or significant increase in demand, of PET resin and additives may result in higher market prices and thereby increase our cost of sales. The prices of PET resin and additives are, to a certain extent, affected by the price movement of crude oil. The international market prices for crude oil increased in 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, which caused the price of raw materials to increase. In addition it is difficult to pass all the increase in cost of raw materials to customers, which in turn limits our profitability. In 2010, if there is a significant increase in the cost of raw materials, as the the economy has not fully recovered, we may not be able to pass the increase in costs of raw materials to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, the fluctuation of the crude oil price will continue to have an adverse impact on our operation. Currently, we have no hedging transactions in place with respect to PET resin or any other petroleum product. Entry of new BOPET producers and continuously expanded production capacity of current BOPET film manufacturers in the industry in the PRC may increase the supply of, and decrease the prices of, BOPET film in the industry, and hence lead to a decline in our profit margins. We believe that we are currently one of the few producers of BOPET film in the PRC with research and development capability. Over time, there may be new investors into BOPET film industry, whether as a result of increased access to the production technology of BOPET film or increasing demand of BOPET films in the domestic market or otherwise. At the same time the current BOPET films manufacturers are expanding their productivity. Accordingly, we may experience increased competition which could result in more competitive pricing. In the event that we are unable to compete successfully or retain effective control over the pricing of our products, our profit margins will decrease and our revenues and net income may also continue to decrease. In addition, China has gradually lowered import tariffs and relaxed foreign investment restrictions after its entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001. This may lead to increased competition from foreign companies in our industry some of which are significantly larger and financially stronger than us. If we fail to compete effectively with these companies in the future, our current business and future growth potential would be adversely affected. We maybe subject to inventory risks that would negatively impact our operating results. The possible price decline of the inventory may adversely affect the Company’s operation. To some extent, the price of raw materials and end-productions of our inventories are affected by the price of crude oil. If the price of crude oil keeps increase it may lead to a higher cost of our raw material; to the contrary, the continue declining of the price of the crude oil may cause the price decrease of the end-productions, which will adversely affect our operation. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the flexible packaging industry in the PRC, our revenue might be adversely impacted if the flexible packaging industry is adversely affected. A significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from the production and sale of BOPET film. Our BOPET film is largely used for the flexible packaging industry, such as relating to the processed food and tobacco packaging, cosmetics and alcoholic beverages. The demand for our BOPET film is therefore indirectly affected by the demand for flexible packaging. Any decrease in the demand for our BOPET film will significantly affect our financial performance. The global financial crisis has caused a slowdown in the demand for growth in the PRC market and a decrease in demand in the overseas market for our products, which as a result, has led to the decline both in sales quantity or the sales price of our products. If the economy slowdown continues, it could continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition, business and operation. 8 We rely on key managerial and technical personnel and failure to attract or retain such personnel may compromise our ability to perform our strategies and then to develop new products and to effectively carry on our research and development and other efforts. Our success to date has been largely attributable to the contributions of key management and experienced personnel, some with whom we have entered into service agreements. The loss of their services might impede the achievements of our strategies and development objectives and might damage the close business relationship we currently enjoy with some of our larger customers. Our continued success is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to attract or retain the services of these key personnel. Except for Mr. Xiaoan He, we do not currently maintain any other key man insurance for our directors or officers. Our R&D center is managed by Mr. Hanyong Lee. If he does not effectively lead the R&D team to research and develop new products and facilitate the marketing process, or we are unable to receive our R&D team’s services continuously, or we are unable to recruit outstanding R&D personnel as a replacement, this may have an adverse affect on our ability to progress and develop new products, and may adversely affect our business results and market competitiveness. Marketability of any of our new products is uncertain and low acceptance levels of any of our new products will adversely affect our revenue and profitability. The development of our products is based on complex technology, and requires significant time and expertise in order to meet industry standards and customers’ specifications. Although we have developed some products that meet customers’ requirements in the past, there is no assurance that any of our research and development efforts will necessarily lead to any new or enhanced products or generate sufficient market share to justify commercialization. We must continually improve our current products and develop competitive new products to address the requirements of our customers. If our new products are unable to gain market acceptance, we would not be able to generate future revenue from our investment in research and development. In such event, we would be unable to increase our market share and achieve and sustain profitability. Our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce new products attractive to the market could cause our products to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could reduce our market share and cause our sales to decline. We may not be able to complete our new production line (thick film) currently under construction and start production in the near future. This may have an adverse impact on us and cause losses due to potential claims that may be raised by the supplier of equipments. The new production line (thick film) project, which is currently under construction, still has a shortage of funds of US$ 20 million to US$ 25 million out of the total expected investment required for this new production line of approximately US$ 40 million to US$ 45 million. Although our management has made its best efforts to obtain additional financing, it has not been successful due to various adverse factors, such as the shareholders case, general weak economy and our inability to obtain financing through issuing shares or bonds caused by the continuous decline in our share price. As a result, we may fail to make payments to suppliers on equipment. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing and pay our suppliers, we may encounter potential litigation from our suppliers or lost the ordered equipment. In the event that there is a claim for the breach of contract by our suppliers, we may endure a significant loss. In addition, although the plant has been completed and certain other equipment has been delivered, if we lost the production line or suppliers refuse to suply equipments to us, we cannot begin production without the main production line being completed. This may have a material adverse impact in the Company’s development of thick films industry. 9 The circumstances under which we acquired ownership of our main productive assets may jeopardize our ability to continue as an operating business. Substantially all of our operating assets were acquired through two auction proceedings under relevant PRC law. We acquired the Brückner production line in 2003 as a result of a foreclosure proceeding enforcing an effective court judgment and the DMT production in 2004 as a result of a commercial auction from a consigner who obtained such assets through a bankruptcy proceeding. In the opinion of our PRC counsel, Concord & Partners, these proceedings are both valid under Chinese auction and bankruptcy law based on certain factual assumptions. Our PRC counsel’s opinion solely relates to the legal procedure of the auctions and is based upon certain factual assumptions, our written representations and written reports of the auction company and other related parties. There can be no assurance that relevant authorities or creditors of the predecessor owner of these assets will not challenge the effectiveness of these asset transfers based upon the facts and circumstances of these transfers, despite the existence of independent appraisals, and other facts and circumstances of the auctions that cannot be verified by our PRC counsel. Taking into consideration the facts known by our PRC counsel related to the auction of the Brückner production line and the significant difference in the price paid for the DMT production line at the two bankruptcy auctions involved in our purchase of that asset and, assuming the representations and reports received by our PRC counsel are true and correct in all material respects, our PRC counsel is of the opinion that the auctions of the Brückner and DMT production lines were valid under PRC law and the possibility of the creditors of Shandong Neo-Luck successfully exercising recourse or claiming repayment with respect to our assets purchased in the bankruptcy proceeding should be remote. However, should any such challenge be brought in China (or elsewhere) and prevail, we may incur substantial liabilities and be required to pay substantial damages as a result of acquiring these assets. Although we believe any such challenge is unlikely to lead to the forfeiture of the related assets, it could materially affect our ability to continue operations. On June 25, 2007, we announced the investigation of three controlling shareholders, Mr. Jun Yin, Mr. Duo Wang, and Mr. Tongju Zhou, and on September 28, 2007, the three shareholders have been arrested, relating to the suspicion of the Crime of Irregularities for Favoritism and to sell state-owned assets at low prices. On November 12, 2009, the company announced that it had become aware of the final verdict issued by the Supreme People's Court of Shandong Province, concerning the Company's three major shareholders, Mr. Jun Yin, Mr. Tongju Zhou and Mr. Duo Wang. The Supreme People's Court upheld the initial verdict issued by the Intermediate court in March 2009. The March 2009 initial verdict sentenced Mr. Yin to death, with a stay of execution for two years; the other two defendants, Mr. Zhou and Mr. Wang, each received life imprisonment; all of the personal property of the three individuals will be confiscated. The three individuals appealed the initial verdict to the Supreme People's Court of Shandong Province in March 2009. None of these individuals is involved in Fuwei's day-to-day operations. The final judgement aginst the three shareholders may cause uncertainty of the company’s operation. We have, in the past, experienced and may, from time to time, experience negative working capital. We also face risks associated with debt financing (including exposure to variation in interest rates). Our total short-term loan as of December 31, 2009 was RMB 153.2 million (US$22.4 million), which excludes RMB 25 million (US$ 3.7 million) in long-term loans. We have pledged property, plant and equipment and lease prepayments as security for RMB 165.0 million (US$ 24.2 million) of the above outstanding indebtedness. In the event that we default on all expired indebtedness, our lenders could foreclose on our assets. In the event that our assets are foreclosed upon, we will not be able to continue to operate our business. Our obligations under our existing loans have been mainly met through the cash flow from our operations and our financing activities. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk of significant increases in interest rates and the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payment of principal and interest. In the past, cash flows from operations have been sufficient to meet payment obligations. There is however, no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. We may also underestimate our capital requirements and other expenditures or overestimate our future cash flows. In such event, we may consider additional bank loans, issuing bonds, or other forms of financing to satisfy our capital requirements. If any of the aforesaid events occur and we are unable for any reason to raise additional capital, debt or other financing to meet our working capital requirements, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial position will be adversely affected. For example, if we fail to get appropriate financing, it will negatively impact the investment in the production of our third production line. In addition, if we do not obtain financing or have negative working capital, there is a possibility that we may not be able to perform our contracts with our suppliers as a result of our inability to pay them. All of these factors may cause a significant adverse effect on our operations. 10 We may lose our competitive advantage and our operations may suffer if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of, or disputes over, our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2009, we have received four patents from, and have thirteen patent applications pending with the PRC authorities. All these patents are related to our products and production processes. We may not be able to successfully obtain the approvals of the PRC authorities for the pending patent applications. Furthermore, third parties may assert claims to our proprietary processes and technologies. These products, proprietary processes and technologies are important to our business as they allow us to maintain our competitive edge over our competitors. Our ability to compete in our markets and to achieve future revenue growth will depend, to a certain extent, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. The legal regime in China for the protection of intellectual property rights is still at its early stage of development. Intellectual property protection became a national effort in China in 1979 when China adopted its first statute on the protection of trademarks. Since then, China has adopted its Patent Law, Trademark Law and Copyright Law and promulgated related regulations, such as the Regulation on Computer Software Protection, Regulation on the Protection of Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits and Regulation on Internet Domain Names. China has also acceded to various international treaties and conventions in this area, such as the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Patent Cooperation Treaty, Madrid Agreement and its Protocol Concerning the International Registration of Marks. In addition, when China became a party to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China amended many of its laws and regulations to comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Despite many laws and regulations promulgated and other efforts made by China over the years with a view to tightening up its regulation and protection of intellectual property rights, private parties may not enjoy intellectual property rights in China to the same extent as they would in many Western countries, including the United States, and enforcement of such laws and regulations in China have not achieved the levels reached in those countries. Both the administrative agencies and the court system in China are not well-equipped to deal with violations or handle the nuances and complexities between compliant technological innovation and non-compliant infringement. We rely on trade secrets and registered patents and trademarks to protect our intellectual property. We have also entered into confidentiality agreements with our management and employees relating to our confidential proprietary information. However, the protection of our intellectual properties may be compromised as a result of: · departure of any of our management members or employees in possession of our confidential proprietary information; · breach by such departing management member or employee of his or her confidentiality and non-disclosure undertaking to us; · expiration of the protection period of our registered patents or trademarks; · infringement by others of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights; or · refusal by relevant regulatory authorities to approve our patent or trademark applications. Any of these events or occurrences may reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. There is no assurance that the measures that we have put into place to protect our intellectual property rights will be sufficient. As the number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases, and as the coverage of these rights and the functionality of the products in the market further overlap, we believe that business entities in our industry may face more frequent infringement claims. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and may not be successful. If we are not able to successfully defend our intellectual property rights, we might lose the rights to technology that we need to conduct and develop our business. This may seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition, and enable our competitors to use our intellectual property to compete against us. 11 Furthermore, if third parties claim that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, we might be required to devote substantial resources to defending against such claims. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such infringement claims, we may be required to pay damages, modify our products or suspend the production and sale of such products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to modify our products on commercially reasonable terms. We may incur capital expenditures in the future in connection with our growth plans and therefore may require additional financing. To expand our business, we will need to increase our production variety and productivity which will require substantial capital expenditures. Such expenditures are likely to be incurred in advance of any increase in sales. We cannot assure you that our revenue will increase after such capital expenditures are incurred as this will depend on, among other factors, our ability to maintain or achieve high capacity utilization rates. Any failure to increase our revenue after incurring capital expenditures to expand production capacity will reduce our profitability. In addition, we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund our capital expenditures. Additional equity financing may result in dilution to existing shareholders’ return. Additional debt financing may be required which, if obtained, may: · limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek consents for the payment of dividends; · increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; · limit our ability to pursue our growth plan; · require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations as payment for our debt, thereby reducing availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes; · limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and/or · We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. A disruption in the supply of utilities, fire or other calamity at our manufacturing plant would disrupt production of our products and adversely affect our sales. Our BOPET films are manufactured solely at our production facility located in Weifang City in the PRC. Any disruption in the supply of utilities, in particular, electricity or power supply or any outbreak of fire, flood or other calamity resulting in significant damage at our facilities would severely affect our production of BOPET film and, as a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for product development or result in a loss of equipment and properties. While we maintain insurance policies covering losses in respect of damage to our properties, machinery and inventories of raw materials and products, we cannot assure you that our insurance would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. We have limited experience in operating outside mainland China, and failure to achieve our overseas expansion strategy may have an adverse effect on our business growth in the future. Our future growth depends, to a considerable extent, on our ability to develop both the domestic and overseas markets. We are currently exploring new business opportunities outside mainland China for our BOPET film products. We have a limited number of customers outside China, mainly in South Korea, the United States and Europe. However, we have limited experience in operating outside mainland China, have limited experience with foreign regulatory environments and market practices, and cannot guarantee that we will be able to penetrate any overseas market. In connection with our initial efforts to expand overseas, we have encountered many obstacles, including cultural and linguistic differences, difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments in foreign jurisdictions, and political and social disturbances. Failure in the development of overseas markets may have an adverse effect on our business growth in the future. 12 We have encountered anti-dumping investigations in South Korea and the United States. Although we received approvals for comparatively low anti-dumping tax rates in the final anti-dumping arbitration judgments in South Korea and the United States, our overseas expansion strategy in our future business growth may be adversely affected. Since 2007, the manufacturers in China, India and other countries have encountered anti-dumping investigations conducted by South Korea and the United States. The Korean Trading Committee (KTC) announced the final results for anti-dumping investigations for enterprises in China and India on August 27, 2008. Although we finally received the anti-dumping duties (ADD) rate of 5.67% which is much lower than the average rate of 23.60% for other enterprises in China, our export to South Korea is still adversely affected by paying the ADD to a certain extent. The US Department of Commerce conducted the anti-dumping investigation in October, 2007 covering exporters in China, Brazil, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. 41 exporters in China were under investigation. In October 2008, the anti-dumping judgments were announced. Although we received the lowest ADD rate of 3.49% among five exporters that received a duty, our export to the United States, to a certain extent, is still adversely affected by paying the ADD. On December 12, 2009, the US Department of Commerce will begin to review the results of anti-dumping investigation in 2008. If we can not aquire a relatively low rate, it will not only have a significant impact on our export to the US market but also make us face the risk to repay the US anti-dumping duties for the last two years. In addition, if other countries or regions, such as the European Union, take trade protection measures against China's BOPET film or downstream industries, our business may be adversely affected. New governmental regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations. Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are bills pending in Congress that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity and gas, and emit amounts of greenhouse gas are likely to be affected by existing proposals. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could significantly increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our business, operations or financial results. While future emission regulation appears likely, it is too early to predict how this regulation will affect our business, operations or financial results. 13 Our primary source of funds for dividends and other distributions from our operating subsidiary in China is subject to various legal and contractual restrictions and uncertainties, and our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our shareholders are negatively affected by those restrictions and uncertainties. We are a holding company established in the Cayman Islands and conduct our core business operations through our principal operating subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, in China. As a result, our profits available for distribution to our shareholders are dependent on the profits available for distribution from Shandong Fuwei. If Shandong Fuwei incurs debt on its own behalf, the debt instruments may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions, which in turn would limit our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares. Under the current PRC laws, because we are incorporated in the Cayman Islands, our PRC subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, is regarded as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China. Although dividends paid by foreign invested enterprises, such as wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign joint ventures, are not subject to any PRC corporate withholding tax, the PRC laws permit payment of dividends only out of net income as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Determination of net income under PRC accounting standards and regulations may differ from determination under U.S. GAAP in significant respects, such as the use of different principles for recognition of revenues and expenses. In addition, distribution of additional equity interests by our PRC subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, to us (which is credited as fully paid through capitalizing its undistributed profits) requires additional approval of the PRC government due to an increase in our registered capital and total investment in Shandong Fuwei. Under the PRC laws, Shandong Fuwei, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, is required to set aside a portion of its net income each year to fund designated statutory reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. As a result, our primary internal source of funds of dividend payments from Shandong Fuwei is subject to these and other legal and contractual restrictions and uncertainties, which in turn may limit or impair our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Moreover, any transfer of funds from us to Shandong Fuwei, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, is subject to registration with or approval by PRC governmental authorities. These limitations on the flow of funds between us and Shandong Fuwei could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions. Investor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely impacted if we or our independent registered public accountants are unable to issue an unqualified opinion on the adequacy of our internal controls over our financial reporting beginning as of December 31, 2010, as required by Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a public company, we are required by section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 to include a report by management on our internal controls over financial reporting that contains our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010. We have documented, tested, and evaluated our internal controls as required. Our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective in 2009. Moreover, although our management does conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, if our independent registered public accountants are not satisfied with our internal control structure and procedures, the level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent registered public accountants interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently from us, they may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our shares. Risks Relating to Business Operations in China Changes in China’s political and economic policies and conditions could cause a substantial decline in the demand for our products and services. Currently, we derive substantially most of our revenues from mainland China. We anticipate that mainland China will continue to be our primary production and sales base in the near future. In addition, currently, substantially all of our assets are located in China and most of our services are performed in China. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, sales to our customers in the PRC accounted for approximately 75.5%, 86.9% and 88.9%, respectively, of our total revenue. Accordingly, any significant slowdown in the PRC economy or decline in demand for our products from our customers in the PRC will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. Furthermore, any unfavorable changes in the social and political conditions of the PRC may also adversely affect our business and operations. Since the adoption of the “open door policy” in 1978 and the “socialist market economy” in 1993, the PRC government has been reforming and is expected to continue to reform its economic and political systems. Any changes in the political and economic policy of the PRC government may lead to changes in the laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same, as well as changes in the foreign exchange regulations, taxation and import and export restrictions, which may in turn adversely affect our financial performance. While the current policy of the PRC government seems to be one of imposing economic reform policies to encourage foreign investments and greater economic decentralization, there is no assurance that such a policy will continue to prevail in the future. We cannot make any assurances that our operations would not be adversely affected should there be any policy changes. 14 Because of the global financial crisis, the Chinese government implemented policies to stimulate economic growth and to encourage investment, by reducing bank deposit and loan interest rates. However, from the fourth quarter of 2009, the Chinese government increased the bank deposit reserve ratio by double. Changes in these policies may adversely effect the Company's operations. The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments or other incentives currently available to us in the PRC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, was converted into a wholly foreign owned enterprise in January 2005 and enjoys certain special or preferential tax treatments regarding enterprise income tax in accordance with the “Income Tax Law of the PRC for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises.” Accordingly, it is entitled to tax concessions whereby the profit for the first two financial years beginning with the first profit-making year (after setting off tax losses carried forward from prior years) is exempt from income tax in the PRC and the profit for each of the subsequent three financial years is taxed at 50% of the prevailing tax rates set by the relevant tax authorities. In addition, as a “High Technology Enterprise,” Shandong Fuwei currently enjoys enterprise income tax at an incentive rate of 15%. Although Shandong Fuwei was redesignated as a High-and-New Tech Enterprise in December 2008 and enjoys the favorable income tax rate, if there are any future changes in PRC tax laws, rules and regulations or Shandong Fuwei will not be designated as a High-and-New Tech Enterprise ， Shandong Fuwei will no longer enjoy the preferential tax treatment. If that were to occur, Shandong Fuwei would be subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax rate which would significantly increase our effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our operating results. On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC passed the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China, which law took effect on January 1, 2008. In accordance with the new law, a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25% and unified tax deduction standards were applied equally to both domestic-invested enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises such as Shandong Fuwei. Enterprises established prior to March 16, 2007 eligible for preferential tax treatment in accordance with the currently prevailing tax laws and administrative regulations would, under the regulations of the State Council, gradually become subject to the new tax rate over a five-year transition period starting from the date of effectiveness of the new law. We expect details of the transitional arrangement for the five-year period from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012 applicable to enterprises approved for establishment prior to March 16, 2007, such as Shandong Fuwei, to be set out in more detailed implementing rules to be adopted in the future. In addition, certain qualifying “High Technology Enterprises” may still benefit from a preferential tax rate of 15% under the new tax law if they meet the definition of “Government Developing High Technology Enterprise” to be set forth in the more detailed implementing rules when they become adopted. Shandong Fuwei was redesignated as a High-and-New Tech Enterprise in December, 2008 and enjoys the favorable income tax rate of 15% pursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the PRC. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the PRC. Any failure by us to comply fully with such laws and regulations will result in us being subject to penalties and fines or being required to pay damages. Although we believe we are currently in compliance with the environmental regulations in all material respects, any change in the regulations may require us to acquire equipment or incur additional capital expenditure or costs in order to comply with such regulations. Our profits will be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on such additional costs to our customers. 15 Changes in foreign exchange regulations in China may affect our ability to pay dividends in foreign currencies. We currently receive most of our operating revenues in Renminbi. Currently, Renminbi is not a freely convertible currency and the restrictions on currency exchanges in China may limit our ability to use revenues generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China or to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars. The PRC government strictly regulates conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies. Over the years, the PRC government has significantly reduced its control over routine foreign exchange transactions under current accounts, including trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions, foreign debt service and payment of dividends. In accordance with the existing foreign exchange regulations in China, our PRC subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, is able to pay dividends in foreign currencies, without prior approval from the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. The PRC government may, however, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions and prohibit us from converting our Renminbi-denominated earnings into foreign currencies. If this occurs, our PRC subsidiary may not be able to pay us dividends in foreign currency without prior approval from SAFE. In addition, conversion of Renminbi for most capital account items, including direct investments, is still subject to government approval in China and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. This restriction may limit our ability to invest earnings of Shandong Fuwei. Fluctuation in the value of Renminbi could adversely affect our overseas sales and import of raw materials and the value of, and dividends payable on, our shares in foreign currency terms. The value of Renminbi is subject to various factors and depends to a large extent on China’s domestic and international economic, financial and political developments, as well as the currency’s supply and demand in the local market. From 1994, the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, was based on exchange rates set and published daily by the People’s Bank of China, the PRC central bank, based on the previous day’s interbank foreign exchange market rates in China and exchange rates on the world financial markets. The official exchange rate for the conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars remained stable until Renminbi was revalued in July 2005 and allowed to fluctuate by reference to a basket of foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a band against a basket of foreign currencies. This change in policy resulted initially in an approximately 2.0% appreciation in the value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantially more liberalized currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Further revaluations of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar may also occur in the future. Since our income and profits are denominated in Renminbi, fluctuation in the value of Renminbi could adversely affect our overseas sales and import of raw materials and further negtively affect our revenue and net income. Any appreciation of Renminbi would increase the value of, and any dividends payable on, our shares in foreign currency terms. Conversely, any depreciation of Renminbi would decrease the value of, and any dividends payable on, our shares in foreign currency terms. The uncertain legal environment in China could limit the legal protections available to you. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, the civil law system is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In the late 1970s, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations to provide general guidance on economic and business practices in China and to regulate foreign investment. Our PRC subsidiary, Shandong Fuwei, is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise and is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China in general and laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises in particular. China has made significant progress in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. However, the promulgation of new laws, changes of existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on our business and prospects. In addition, as these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and because of the limited volume of published cases and their non-binding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and legal requirements involve significant uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors, including you. For example, it is not clear if a PRC court would enforce in China a foreign court decision brought by you against us in shareholders’ derivative actions. Moreover, the enforceability of contracts in China, especially with the government, is relatively uncertain. If counterparties repudiated our contracts or defaulted on their obligations, we might not have adequate remedies. Such uncertainties or inability to enforce our contracts could materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. 16 Outbreak of viruses such as SARS, H1N1 or other epidemics could materially and adversely affect our overall operations and results of operations. From March to July 2003, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and some other areas in Asia experienced an outbreak of a new and contagious form of atypical pneumonia known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. A recurrent outbreak, or an outbreak of a similarly contagious disease, such as the H1N1 avian flu, could potentially disrupt our operations to the extent that any one of our employees is suspected of having the infection or that any of our facilities is identified as a possible source of spreading the virus or disease. We may be required to quarantine employees who are suspected of having an infection. We may also be required to disinfect our facilities and therefore suffer a suspension of production of indefinite duration. Any quarantine or suspension of production at any of our facilities will adversely affect our overall operations. In the recent two years, infectious disease like H1N1 has occurred in high frequency worldwide, which would have adverse effect on the consumption on packaged foods, and have influence on our products sales. In addition, any such outbreak will likely restrict the level of economic activities in the affected areas, which could lead to a substantial decrease in our revenues accompanied by an increase in our costs. Regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and adversely affect our business and prospects. In October 2005, SAFE issued a circular (SAFE circular 75) concerning foreign exchange regulation on investments by PRC residents in China through special purpose companies incorporated overseas. The circular states that, if PRC residents use assets or equity interests in their domestic entities as capital contribution to establish offshore companies or inject assets or equity interests of their PRC entities into offshore companies to raise capital overseas, such PRC residents must register with local SAFE branches in advance with respect to their overseas investments in offshore companies and must also file amendments to their registrations within 30 days upon the generation of material events if their offshore companies experience material events, such as changes in share capital, share transfer, mergers and acquisitions, spin-off transactions or use of assets in China to guarantee offshore obligations which are not involved with return investment. Our existing shareholders prior to our initial public offering the offering have completed the relevant SAFE registration procedures as currently required by SAFE circular 75. On May 29, 2007, SAFE issued the operative measures of SAFE circular 75 (SAFE circular 106), which specified the registration and approval procedures of SAFE circular 75. As it is uncertain how these existing regulations, and any future legislation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities, we cannot predict how this circular and other SAFE circulars will affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our ability to provide funds to us to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.
