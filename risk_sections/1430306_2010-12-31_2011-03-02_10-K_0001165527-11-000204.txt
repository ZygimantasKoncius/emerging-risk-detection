ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS OUR AUDITORS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION, THEREFORE THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATING activities. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. As such we may have to cease activities and investors could lose their investment. BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL PROSPECT EVER HAVING RESERVES IS EXTREMELY REMOTE, ANY FUNDS SPENT ON EXPLORATION WILL PROBABLY BE LOST. 5 The probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is extremely remote. In all probability any property we carry out exploration on may not contain any reserves. As such, any funds spent on exploration will probably be lost. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NO TECHNICAL TRAINING OR EXPERIENCE IN EXPLORING FOR, STARTING, AND OPERATING AN EXPLORATION PROGRAM. MANAGEMENT'S DECISIONS AND CHOICES MAY NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT STANDARD ENGINEERING OR MANAGERIAL APPROACHES MINERAL EXPLORATION COMPANIES COMMONLY USE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE ACTIVITIES. Our management has limited experience with exploring for, starting, and operating an exploration program. Further, our management has no direct training or experience in these areas and as a result may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within the industry. Management's decisions and choices may not take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches mineral exploration companies commonly use. Consequently our activities, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to management's lack of experience in this industry. WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE LOSSES WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY HAVE TO SUSPEND OR CEASE ACTIVITIES. We were incorporated in November 2007 and we have not started our proposed business activities or realized any revenues. We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our net loss was $70,681 from inception to December 31, 2010. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon: * our ability to locate a profitable mineral property * our ability to generate revenues * our ability to reduce exploration costs. Based upon current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. This will happen because there are expenses associated with the research and exploration of mineral properties. As a result, we may not generate revenues in the future. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to suspend or cease activities. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DANGERS INVOLVED IN MINERAL EXPLORATION, THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY INCUR LIABILITY OR DAMAGES, WHICH COULD HURT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND POSSIBLY RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF OUR BUSINESS. The search for valuable minerals involves numerous hazards. As a result, we may become subject to liability for such hazards, including pollution, cave-ins and other hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. The payment of such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, WE MAY HAVE TO LIMIT OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITY. 6 Because we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our exploration activity. As such we may not be able to complete an exploration program that is as thorough as we would like. In that event, an existing reserve may go undiscovered. Without a reserve, we cannot generate revenues. WE MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS WE NEED TO BEGIN EXPLORATION WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO DELAY OR SUSPEND ACTIVITIES. Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies, such as dynamite, and certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators that we might need to conduct exploration. If we cannot find the products and equipment we need, we will have to suspend future exploration plans until we do find the products and equipment we need. BECAUSE OUR OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS OTHER OUTSIDE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING 10% OF HIS TIME OR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS PER WEEK TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF EXPLORATION. Because our officer and director has other outside business activities and will only be devoting 10% of his time or four hours per week to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to our officer and director.
