Item 1A. RISK FACTORS NewMil is the registered bank holding company for the Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary. NewMil's activity is currently limited to the holding of the Bank's outstanding capital stock and the Bank is NewMil's primary investment. An investment in NewMil common stock entails certain risks. NewMil considers the most significant factors affecting risk in NewMil common stock as those that are set forth below. There are not the only risks of an investment in NewMil common stock, and none of the factors set forth below relates to the personal circumstances of individual investors. You should read this entire Form 10-K, as well as other documents and exhibits that are incorporated by reference in the 10-K and that have been filed with the SEC, in order to better understand these risks and to evaluate investment in NewMil common stock. Competition Risk Competition in the banking industry is intense and NewMil's market areas are particularly competitive. NewMil competes with savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and investment brokerage firms. NewMil competes with several non-public mutually owned savings banks that price their products with different short-term financial considerations than publicly owned institutions like NewMil. NewMil also competes with regional and national banks that have substantially greater resources and lending limits than does NewMil and can offer services that NewMil does not or cannot offer. Additionally, NewMil competes with non-banking companies, such as mortgage and investment brokerage firms, mutual fund and insurance firms, who offer a range of banking and deposit-like products and services. NewMil’s ability to retain and grow its customer base depends on its ability to continue differentiate itself favorably in the eyes of its customers in its highly competitive markets. Credit Risk NewMil’s lending activities entail taking credit risk. NewMil’s exposure to credit risk in its loan portfolio is dependent on many external variables, such as the level of economic health of national and local markets, and its effect on delinquency levels and the values of underlying collateral, and the level of interest rates. Other internal variables include concentrations, portfolio volume and mix, and lending policy. In recent years NewMil has incurred negligible credit losses as a result of a healthy economy, and appreciating underlying real estate collateral values. NewMil’s ability to manage credit losses is largely dependent on these external factors. Liquidity Risk NewMil manages its liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals, loan originations and advances, securities purchases and other operating cash outflows. NewMil’s primary sources of liquidity are principal payments and maturities of securities and loans, short-term borrowings through repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, net deposit growth and funds provided by operations. Liquidity can also be provided through sales of loans and available-for-sale securities. NewMil’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on its ability to maintain its funding sources. Interest Rate Risk NewMil is exposed to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates affect its loans, securities, deposits and borrowings, and have a combined effect upon NewMil’s net interest income. NewMil manages its exposure to interest rate risk within limits approved by the Board of Directors using an earnings simulation model. The model simulates earnings over a specified time horizon to measure the amount of short-term earnings at risk under a variety of interest rate scenarios. NewMil’s earnings simulation analysis includes numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes, including growth and product mix, prepayments, product pricing and the behavior of interest rates. Earnings simulation modeling includes assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions, and management’s strategies, among other factors. 7 Item 1B.
