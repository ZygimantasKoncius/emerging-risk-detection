risk factors listed in this section could adversely affect our financial results and cause the value of our stock to fall. Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates We are heavily dependent on the success of BA058-SC, and BA058-TD as a follow on product, both of which are under clinical development. We cannot be certain that BA058-SC or BA058-TD will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval. BA058-SC is our only product candidate in late-stage clinical development, and our business currently depends heavily on its successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization. We have no drug products for sale currently and may never be able to develop marketable drug products. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market BA058-SC in the United States unless and until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries unless and until we receive the requisite approval from regulatory authorities in such countries. In addition, the approval of BA058-TD as a follow-on product is dependent on the earlier approval of BA058-SC. We have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. Obtaining approval of an NDA is an extensive, 45 Table of Contents lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and any approval of BA058-SC may be delayed, limited or denied for many reasons, including: we may not be able to demonstrate that BA058 is safe and effective as a treatment for osteoporosis to the satisfaction of the FDA; the results of our clinical studies may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA for marketing approval; the FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical studies; the CRO that we retain to conduct clinical studies may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical studies; the FDA may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate that BA058's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; the FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical studies or may require that we conduct additional studies; the FDA may not accept data generated at our clinical study sites; if our NDA is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical studies, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions; the FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS as a condition of approval; or the FDA may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers. In addition, the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations. For example, on February 15, 2012, we received a letter from the FDA stating that, after internal consideration, the agency believes that a minimum of 24-month fracture data are necessary for approval of new products for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and our ongoing BA058-SC pivotal Phase 3 clinical study is designed to produce fracture data based on an 18-month primary endpoint. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that continued use of the 18-month primary endpoint will be acceptable, provided that our NDA includes the 24-month fracture data derived from a 6-month extension of the BA058 80 µg and placebo groups in our Phase 3 study that will receive an approved alendronate (generic Fosamax®) therapy for osteoporosis management. We plan to file the NDA with the 18-month fracture data and supplementally provide the 24-month fracture data, when available. We cannot be certain that the FDA will not change this approval policy again, or adopt other approval policies or regulations that adversely affect any NDA that we may submit. Before we submit an NDA to the FDA for BA058 as a treatment for osteoporosis, we must complete several additional studies, including, but not limited to, our pivotal Phase 3 study based upon 18-month fracture data, a thorough QT Phase 1 study, a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic, or PK, study in renal patients, a Phase 1 absolute bioavailability PK study, a maximum tolerated dose study, several drug interaction studies, a carcinogenicity study in rats, and bone quality studies in rats and monkeys. We have not commenced all of these required studies and the results of these studies will have an important bearing on the approval of BA058. In addition to fracture and BMD, our pivotal Phase 3 study will measure a number of other potential safety indicators, including anti-BA058 antibodies which will have an important bearing on the approval of BA058. At an interim preliminary analysis of 46 Table of Contents histopathology of pre-terminal rats in our rat carcinogenicity study, which includes BA058 and hPTH(1-34), a daily subcutaneous injection of human parathyroid hormone as a positive control, we have observed osteosarcomas in both the BA058 and hPTH(1-34) treated groups. The final results from the rat carcinogenicity study may show that BA058 dosing results in more osteosarcomas than PTH, at similar exposure multiples to the human therapeutic dose, which may have a material adverse bearing on approval of BA058. If we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for some of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, many of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that could be competitive with our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors' product candidates. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of the company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. If we do not obtain the necessary United States or foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, we will not be able to sell our product candidates. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates, including BA058, RAD1901 and RAD140, or any product candidate we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research and animal tests, which are referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, which are referred to as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA's regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during its regulatory review, such as the request we received from the FDA with respect to providing a minimum of 24-month fracture data for approval of BA058. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may: delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates; impose costly procedures on us; and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain 47 Table of Contents FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire any product candidate. In foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any drugs. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates for sale outside the United States. Most of our product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials. Except for BA058, each of our other product candidates, which are RAD1901 and RAD140, is in early stages of development and requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit an NDA for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or whether any such NDA will be accepted. Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. A substantial portion of our BA058 development costs are denominated in euro and any adverse movement in the dollar/euro exchange rate will result in increased costs and require us to raise additional capital to complete the development of our products. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of BA058-SC will take several additional years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including: changes in government regulation, administrative action or changes in FDA policy with respect to clinical trials that change the requirements for approval; unforeseen safety issues; determination of dosing issues; lack of effectiveness during clinical trials; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols. In addition, we, the FDA, or other regulatory authorities and ethics committees with jurisdiction over our studies may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA or other authorities find deficiencies in our regulatory submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for existing or future clinical trials. The results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. For example, our Phase 3 study of BA058-SC for fracture prevention may not replicate the positive efficacy results for BMD from 48 Table of Contents our Phase 2 study. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the filing of our NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition, our clinical trials to date have involved small patient populations. Because of the small sample sizes, the results of these clinical trials may not be indicative of future results. Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved. Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain marketing approval of a product candidate, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use and, if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including: restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes; restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product; restrictions on product distribution or use; requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials; warning or untitled letters; withdrawal of the products from the market; refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit; voluntary or mandatory recall of products and related publicity requirements; fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue; suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals; refusal to permit the import or export of our products; product seizure; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 49 Table of Contents Physicians and patients may not accept and use our drugs. Even if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, physicians and patients may not accept and use them. Acceptance and use of any of our products will depend upon a number of factors including: perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drug; cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products; availability of coverage and reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any. Because we expect sales of our current product candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future, the failure of these drugs to gain market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. If serious adverse or inappropriate side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates, we may need to abandon our development of some of our product candidates. All of our product candidates are still in preclinical or clinical development. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval, if ever. If our product candidates result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties Our drug development program depends upon third-party researchers, investigators and collaborators who are outside our control. We depend upon independent researchers, investigators and collaborators, such as Nordic, to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us. These third parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These third parties may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug-development programs, or if their performance is 50 Table of Contents substandard, the approval of our FDA applications, if any, and our introduction of new drugs, if any, will be delayed. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed. If a regulatory or governmental authority determines that a financial interest in the outcome of the Phase 3 study of BA058-SC by any of the entities managing our Phase 3 study affected the reliability of the data from the Phase 3 study, our ability to use the data for our planned regulatory submissions could be compromised, which could harm our business and the value of our common stock. The Phase 3 study of BA058-SC is being managed by Nordic at certain clinical sites operated by CCBR, a leading global CRO with extensive experience in global osteoporosis registration studies. Nordic controls, and holds an ownership interest in, the local CCBR clinical sites. The clinical trial investigators are employees of CCBR and may also hold an equity interest in the local CCBR clinical trials. In consideration of Nordic's management of this Phase 3 study, we agreed to make various cash payments to Nordic denominated in both euros and U.S. dollars over the course of the Phase 3 study equal to a total of up to approximately €41.2 million ($54.3 million) and a total of up to approximately $3.2 million. We also agreed to sell shares of capital stock to Nordic that were exchanged in the Merger for 6,443 shares of our series A-5 preferred stock for proceeds of approximately $0.5 million. These shares of our series A-5 preferred stock will automatically convert into 64,430 shares of our common stock upon the listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Nordic, we will also issue to Nordic shares of stock with an aggregate value of up to €36.8 million ($48.5 million). These shares of stock accrue at a quarterly rate based on the progress of the Phase 3 clinical study and are issuable at a price per share equal to the greater of $8.142 or the 20-day average of the closing price of our common stock at any time after our common stock is publicly traded. The fair market value of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including any negative outcome of the Phase 3 study. Accordingly, the shares of stock that we will issue to Nordic in consideration of Nordic's management of the Phase 3 study may be less than the full value contemplated under our agreements with Nordic. As a result, the total consideration that Nordic will receive in cash and stock may be viewed to be below the market price paid by other companies for comparable clinical trial services. Because of the potential decrease in the value of the common stock issuable to Nordic upon a negative outcome of the Phase 3 study, Nordic, CCBR and the clinical trial investigators may be viewed as having a financial interest in the outcome of the study. We have obtained written acknowledgments from the clinical trial investigators certifying that they have no financial interest in the outcome of the Phase 3 study. However, if the FDA, the EMA or any other similar regulatory or governmental authority determines that Nordic, CCBR or the clinical trial investigators have a financial interest that affected the reliability of the data from the Phase 3 study, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and the utility of the Phase 3 data for purposes of our planned regulatory submissions could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock. 51 Table of Contents We will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates. We have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. We have entered into agreements with contract manufacturers to manufacture BA058 for use in clinical trial activities. These contract manufacturers are currently our only source for the production and formulation of BA058. We may not have sufficient clinical supplies of BA058 to complete the Phase 3 study for BA058-SC and the Phase 2 study of BA058-TD but believe that our contract manufacturers will be able to produce sufficient supply of BA058 to complete all of the planned BA058 clinical studies. If our contract manufacturers are unable to produce, in a timely manner, adequate clinical supplies to meet the needs of our clinical studies, we would be required to seek new contract manufacturers that may require us to modify our finished product formulation and modify or terminate our clinical studies for BA058. Any modification of our finished product or modification or termination of our Phase 3 clinical study could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and significantly delay or prevent the commercial launch of the product, which would materially harm our business and impair our ability to raise capital. We depend on a number of single source contract manufacturers to supply key components of BA058. For example, we depend on Lonza Group Ltd., or Lonza, which produces supplies of bulk drug product of BA058 to support BA058-SC and BA058-TD clinical studies and potential commercial launch. We also depend on Ipsen and its subcontractor Vetter Pharma Fertigung GmbH & Co, or Vetter, for the production of finished supplies of BA058-SC and we depend on 3M for the production of BA058-TD. Because of our dependence on Vetter for the "fill and finish" part of the manufacturing process for BA058-SC, we are subject to the risk that Vetter may not have the capacity from time to time to produce sufficient quantities of BA058 to meet the needs of our clinical studies or be able to scale to commercial production of BA058. Because the manufacturing process for BA058-TD requires the use of 3M's proprietary technology, 3M is our sole source for finished supplies of BA058-TD. While we are currently in discussions, to date, neither we nor our collaborators have entered into a long-term agreement with Lonza or Vetter, each of whom currently produce BA058 or related components on a purchase order basis for us. Accordingly, Lonza and Vetter could terminate their relationship with us at any time and for any reason. We may not be able to negotiate long-term agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. If our relationship with any of these contract manufacturers is terminated, or if they are unable to produce BA058 or related components in required quantities, on a timely basis or at all, or if we are forced to accept unfavorable terms for our future relationship, our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. If any of our current product candidates or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future receive FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our drugs or related components. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks: We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms, or at all, because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any. Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs or related components in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any. Our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products. 52 Table of Contents Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards. If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation. Each of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. If we are not able to establish additional collaborations, we may have to alter our development plans. Our product development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates, we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue. Risks Relating to Marketing and Sale of Our Products We have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products and no internal capability to do so. We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborators' strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborators' ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if we are able to do so, that our collaborators will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third-party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in the United States or overseas. 53 Table of Contents If we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer. The market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If any of our product candidates receives FDA approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. If we fail to develop BA058-TD, our commercial opportunity for BA058 will be limited. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer. We will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in: developing drugs; undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials; obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs; formulating and manufacturing drugs; and launching, marketing and selling drugs. Developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Some of the drugs that we are attempting to develop, such as BA058, RAD1901 and RAD140 will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the United States and abroad. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations, and therefore, we may not be able to hire or retain qualified personnel to run all facets of our business. Our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our drugs sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement. Our ability to commercialize our drugs, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from: government and health administration authorities; private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and other healthcare payers. 54 Table of Contents Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such drug. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our product candidates, once approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced. We may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits. The testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. We are a party to a number of intellectual property license agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to BA058, RAD1901 and/or RAD140 fail to adequately protect these assets, we may suffer the loss of the ability to license or successfully commercialize one or more of these candidates. Our commercial success is significantly dependent on intellectual property related to our product portfolio. We are either the licensee or assignee of numerous issued and pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our assets, including BA058, RAD1901 and RAD140. Patents covering BA058 as a composition of matter have been issued in the United States (US Patent No. 5,969,095), Europe and several additional countries. Because the BA058 composition of matter patent was filed in 1996, it is expected to have a normal expiration in approximately 2016 in the United States (this date does not include the possibility of Hatch-Waxman patent term extension which could extend the expiration in the United States into the first quarter of 2021 if an application for extension is made and the maximum extension is granted by the USPTO) and additional countries where it has issued. We and Ipsen are also co-assignees to US Patent No. 7,803,770 that we believe provides exclusivity until 2028 in the United States (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions) for the method of treating osteoporosis with the intended therapeutic dose for BA058-SC. 55 Table of Contents We and Ipsen are also co-assignees to US Patent No. 8,148,333 that we believe provides exclusivity until 2027 in the United States (absent any Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions) for the intended therapeutic formulation for BA058-SC. We and 3M are co-assignees to an international patent application and a corresponding U.S. patent application filed in 2012 which cover various aspects of BA058 for microneedle application. Any issued claims resulting from these applications will expire no earlier than 2032. However, pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of claimed inventions are not always predictable. Additional intellectual property covering BA058-TD technology exists in the form of proprietary information contained by trade secrets. These can be accidentally disclosed to, independently derived by or misappropriated by competitors, possibly reducing or eliminating the exclusivity advantages of this form of intellectual property, thereby allowing those competitors more rapid entry into the marketplace with a competitive product thus reducing our marketing advantage of BA058-TD. In addition, trade secrets may in some instances become publicly available required disclosures in regulatory files. Alternatively, competitors may sometimes reverse engineer a product once it becomes available on the market. Even where a competitor does not use an identical technology for the delivery of BA058, it is possible that they could achieve an equivalent or even superior result using another technology. Such occurrences could lead to either one or more alternative competitor products available on the market and/or one or more generic competitor products on the market with a corresponding decrease in market share and/or price for BA058-TD. Patents covering RAD1901 as a composition of matter have been issued in the United States, Canada and Australia and are pending in Europe and India. The RAD1901composition of matter patent in the United States expires in 2026 (not including any Hatch-Waxman extension). Additional patent applications relating to methods of treating vasomotor symptoms and clinical dosage strengths using RAD1901 have been filed. Pending patent applications in the United States and elsewhere may not issue since the interpretation of the legal requirements of patentability in view of any claimed invention before that patent office are not always predictable. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and/or defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. Patent applications covering RAD140 and other SARM compounds that are part of the SARM portfolio have been granted in the United States, Mexico and Australia, and are pending in the United States and elsewhere. The RAD140 composition of matter case expires in 2029 in the United States (this does not include the possibility of any Hatch-Waxman extension) and additional countries if and when it issues. Since patents are both highly technical and legal documents that are frequently subject to intense litigation pressure, there is risk that even if one or more RAD140 patents does issue and is asserted that the patent(s) will be found invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed when subject to said litigation. Finally, the intellectual property laws and practices can vary considerably from one country to another and also can change with time. As a result, we could encounter challenges or difficulties in building, maintaining and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to patents issued or licensed to us, including interference proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for 56 Table of Contents monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our licensors' patent rights are highly uncertain. Our and our licensors' pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. We may become involved in opposition or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such 57 Table of Contents candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Payments, fees, submissions and various additional requirements must be met in order for pending patent applications to advance in prosecution and issued patents to be maintained. Rigorous compliance with these requirements is essential to procurement and maintenance of patents integral to the product portfolio. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or patent applications will come due for payment periodically throughout the lifecycle of patent applications and issued patents. In order to help ensure that we comply with any required fee payment, documentary and/or procedural requirements as they might relate to any patents for which we are an assignee or co-assignee, we employ competent legal help and related professionals as needed to comply with those requirements. Our outside patent counsel uses Computer Packages, Inc. for patent annuity payments. Failure to meet a required fee payment, document production or procedural requirement can result in the abandonment of a pending patent application or the lapse of an issued patent. In some instances the defect can be cured through late compliance but there are situations where the failure to meet the required event cannot be cured. Such an occurrence could compromise the intellectual property protection around a preclinical or clinical candidate and possibly weaken or eliminate our ability to protect our eventual market share for that product. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. In addition to our patented technology and products, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. In addition, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. If we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products and could be forced to pay damages and defend against litigation. If our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing drug candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; or 58 Table of Contents defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Competitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, our licensors may have rights to file and prosecute such claims and we may be reliant on them to do so. We may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. Some of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Risks Related to Legislation and Administrative Actions Healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations. From time to time, legislation is implemented to reign in rising healthcare expenditures. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or PPACA. PPACA includes a number of provisions 59 Table of Contents affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including annual, non-deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologics, beginning in 2011, and increases in Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, among other things, PPACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. Congress has proposed a number of legislative initiatives to alter PPACA, including possible repeal of PPACA. At this time, it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to certain provisions of PPACA or its entirety. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. Most recently, on August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which may result in such changes as aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013. The full impact on our business of PPACA and the Budget Control Act is uncertain. We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally. We are subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. We are subject to several healthcare regulations and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; the federal healthcare programs' Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; the federal transparency requirements under PPACA, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; federal false claims laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 60 Table of Contents We may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth We may not successfully manage our growth. Our success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management and on administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we may be required to expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our business would be harmed. We may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, divert management attention or dilute stockholder value. We may enter into business combinations and acquisitions. We have limited experience in making acquisitions, which are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including: the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; potential unknown liabilities and expenses; the failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; the maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; and the impairment of relationships with employees as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our business strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price, or we could issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution. We rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace. We are highly dependent on our chief executive officer and our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors. We do not have "key person" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results. 61 Table of Contents If we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed. We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. Risks Relating to Our Securities We have a history of operating losses, expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses in the future, and may never be consistently profitable. We have a limited operating history for you to evaluate our business. We have no approved products and have generated no product revenue from sales. We have primarily incurred operating losses. As of December 31, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of $200.7 million. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, significant resources to fund the research and development of BA058-SC, BA058-RD and our other drug candidates. We need to raise capital immediately in order to continue operating our business. While we may have net income in future periods as the result of non-recurring collaboration revenue, we expect to incur substantial operating losses over the next several years as our clinical trial and drug manufacturing activities increase. As a result, we expect that our accumulated deficit will also increase significantly. Our drug candidates are in varying stages of preclinical and clinical development and may never be approved for sale or generate any revenue. We will not be able to generate product revenue unless and until one of our drug candidates successfully completes clinical trials and receives regulatory approval. Since even our most advanced drug candidate requires substantial additional clinical development, we do not expect to receive revenue from our drug candidates for several years, if at all. Even if we eventually generate revenues, we may never be profitable, and if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. There is not now and never has been any market for our securities and an active market may never develop. You may therefore be unable to re-sell shares of our securities at times and prices that you believe are appropriate. There is no marketactive or otherwisefor our common stock or our preferred stock and neither is eligible for listing or quotation on any securities exchange, automated quotation system or any other over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board, or the OTCBB, or the Pink Sheets. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval to have our common stock quoted on the OTCBB, it is unlikely that an active market for our common stock will develop any time soon thereafter. Accordingly, our common stock is highly illiquid. Because of this illiquidity, you will likely experience difficulty in re-selling such shares at times and prices that you may desire. There is no assurance that our common stock will be listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on an automated quotation system. We plan to seek listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange or quotation of our common stock on the OTCBB, as soon as practicable. However, there is no assurance we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange or automated quotation systems, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other stock exchange or automated quotation system. An investor may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock while our common stock is listed on the OTCBB. If our common stock is listed on the OTCBB, we would be 62 Table of Contents subject to an SEC rule that, if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such rule may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further limit its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Shares of our capital stock issued in the Merger are not freely tradable under federal securities laws, which will limit stockholders' ability to sell such shares of our capital stock. Shares of our preferred stock and our common stock issued as consideration in the Merger pursuant the Merger Agreement are deemed "Restricted Securities" under the federal securities laws, and consequently such shares may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or without an exemption from the Securities Act, such as resales effected in compliance with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding any such exemption, all shares of our stock issued in the Merger are subject to a lock-up provision set forth in the applicable stockholders' agreements and may not be resold prior to the expiration of the specified lock-up period. Because we became an operating company by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms. Additional risks may exist as a result of our becoming a public reporting operating company through a "reverse merger." Security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our capital stock or business. Because we became a public reporting operating company through a reverse merger, there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to provide analyst coverage of our capital stock or business in the future. The resale of shares covered by our existing resale registration statement could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the public market, should one develop, which result would in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity capital. The sale, or availability for sale, of our common stock in the public market pursuant to our existing resale registration statement may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and may impair our ability to raise additional capital by selling equity or equity-linked securities. Our existing resale registration statement registered the resale of a significant number of shares of our common stock. The resale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore, we expect that, because there are a large number of shares registered pursuant to the registration statement, selling stockholders will continue to offer shares covered by such registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to the registration statement may continue for an extended period of time and continued negative pressure on the market price of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity capital. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley and the reporting requirements of federal securities laws, which can be expensive. As a public reporting company, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws. The costs of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC, and furnishing audited reports to 63 Table of Contents stockholders, will cause our expenses to be higher than they would be if we were privately held. We were not currently subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but may be subject to Section 404 in the future. Section 404 may require us, on an annual basis, to review and evaluate our internal controls, and may require our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls. Any failure by us to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as such requirements exist today or may be modified, supplemented or amended in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. For so long as shares of our preferred stock remain outstanding, if we are sold in a transaction yielding less than the liquidation preference payable in the aggregate to holders of outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock may not receive any proceeds from such transaction and may lose their investment entirely. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding 867,204 shares of common stock; 939,612 shares of series A-1 preferred stock; 983,208 shares of series A-2 preferred stock; 142,227 shares of series A-3 preferred stock; 3,998 shares of series A-4 preferred stock; 6,443 shares of series A-5 preferred stock; warrants to acquire 14,734 shares of series A-1 preferred stock; and warrants to acquire 266 shares of common stock. As more fully described herein and in our Certificate of Incorporation, holders of shares of our preferred stock outstanding at the time of a sale or liquidation will have a right to receive proceeds, if any, from any such transactions, before any payments are made to holders of our common stock. In the event that there are not enough proceeds to satisfy the entire liquidation preference of our preferred stock, holders of our common stock will receive nothing in respect of their equity holdings. We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. As a public company that may become listed on a national securities exchange, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company and prior to any listing of our common stock. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act we may be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm at such time as we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. 64 Table of Contents Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders have substantial control over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control. As of December 31, 2012, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than five percent of our common stock, together with their affiliates, owned, in the aggregate, substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by: delaying, deferring or preventing a change in corporate control; impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Certain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include: the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; the ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; and the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the directors or any officer instructed by the directors to call the meeting, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors. We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction by which such holder acquired the stock. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2012, we had $194.4 million of federal and $161.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not performed a detailed analysis to determine whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has previously occurred. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 65 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
