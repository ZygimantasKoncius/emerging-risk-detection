Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted. These risks are not the only ones we face. There may be additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business. We may lose market share due to competition, which would decrease our future sales and earnings. The furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented. We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers. Some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and some often offer extensively advertised, well-recognized, branded products. Additionally, competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically in the past few years. These foreign producers typically have lower selling prices due to their lower operating costs. As a result, we may not be able to maintain or to raise the prices of our products in response to such competitive pressures or increasing costs. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to differentiate our products (through styling, finish and other construction techniques) from those of our competitors. Large retail furniture dealers have the ability to obtain offshore sourcing on their own. As a result, we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share, which may lower our sales and earnings. We have been increasing our offshore capabilities to provide flexibility in product offerings and pricing to meet competitive pressures, but this approach may adversely affect our ability to service customers, which could lower future sales and earnings. Our sourcing vendors may not supply goods that meet our manufacturing, quality or safety specifications, in a timely manner and at an acceptable price. We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications and either manufacture or find alternative vendors potentially at a higher cost, or may be forced to discontinue the product. Also, delivery of goods from our foreign sourcing vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered with domestic manufacturing or sourcing, such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues. Changes in political, economic, and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations in the other countries from which we source products could adversely affect us. This could make it more difficult for us to service our customers. International trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products could adversely affect us. Imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports, taxes, import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings. Also, significant fluctuations of foreign exchange rates against the value of the U.S. dollar could increase costs and decrease earnings. Efforts to realign manufacturing could decrease our near-term earnings. We continually review our manufacturing operations and offshore sourcing capabilities. As a result, we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs. These programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures. We also may shift certain products to or from domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing. These realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near-term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions. We may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated, and we may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions. An economic downturn could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings. Economic downturns could affect consumer-spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings, recreational vehicles and commercial products and adversely affect our business. Interest rates, consumer confidence, housing starts, and geopolitical factors that affect many other businesses are particularly significant to us because our products are consumer goods. 5 If we experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials, this could cause manufacturing delays, adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers and increase our costs, any of which could decrease our sales and earnings. We use various types of wood, fabrics, leathers, upholstered filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing furniture. Because we are dependent on outside suppliers for all of our raw material needs, we must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from our suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We have no long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of these raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet demands of our customers. The inability to meet our customersÂ’ demands could result in the loss of future sales, and we may not always be able to pass along price increases to our customers due to competitive and marketing pressures. Our failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashions in a timely manner could adversely affect our business and decrease our sales and earnings. Furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing consumer trends and tastes. If we are unable to predict or respond to changes in these trends and tastes in a timely manner, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. This could lower our sales and earnings. If we experience the loss of large customers through business failures (or for other reasons), any extended business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, or problems with our fabric suppliers, this could decrease our future sales and earnings. Although we have no customers that individually represent 10% or more of our net sales, the possibility of business failures by, or the loss of, large customers could decrease our future sales and earnings. Lost sales may be difficult to replace and any amounts owed to us may become uncollectible. Our inability to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in market share decreases. The financial condition of some of our fabric suppliers could impede their ability to provide these products to us in a timely matter. We have seen the number of domestic suppliers declining, and a majority of those larger suppliers that remain are experiencing financial difficulties. In addition, upholstered furniture is highly fashion oriented, and if we are not able to acquire sufficient fabric variety, or if we are unable to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends, we may lose sales and have to sell excess inventory at reduced prices. At times it is necessary we discontinue certain relationships with customers (retailers) who do not meet our growth, credit or profitability standards. Until realignment is established, there can be a decrease in near-term sales and earnings. We continually review relationships with our customers (retailers) and future realignments are possible based upon such ongoing reviews. We are, and may in the future be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability or environmental matters, some of which claim significant damages and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We face the business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. We maintain insurance against product liability claims, but there can be no assurance such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with, or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under, environmental laws. We may engage in acquisitions and investments in businesses, which could dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we may make acquisitions and investments in businesses that offer complementary products. Risks commonly encountered in acquisitions include the possibility that we pay more than the acquired company or assets are worth, the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of our management from ongoing business. Consideration paid for future acquisitions could be in the form of cash or stock or a combination thereof. Dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share may result in connection with any such future acquisition. 6 We may experience impairment of our long-lived assets, which would decrease our earnings and net worth. Accounting rules require that long-lived assets be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have substantial long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, which based upon such events or changes in circumstances there could be a write-down of all or a portion of these assets negatively impacting earnings. Restrictive covenants in our existing credit facilities may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. Our existing credit facilities limit our ability, among other things, to: incur additional indebtedness; make investments; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and create liens. The restrictions contained in our credit facilities could: limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our best interest. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facilities. If a default occurs, the lender under our credit agreement may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable which would result in an event of default under our outstanding notes. The lender will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lender will also have the right to initiate collection proceedings against us. If the indebtedness under our credit facilities were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness under the credit facilities and our other indebtedness. Terms of collective bargaining agreements and labor disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations. We employ approximately 2,250 people, 32% of whom are covered by union contracts. Where a significant portion of our workers are unionized, our ability to implement productivity improvements and effect savings with respect to health care, pension and other retirement costs is more restricted than in many nonunion operations as a result of various restrictions specified in our collective bargaining agreements. Terms of collective bargaining agreements that prevent us from competing effectively could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are committed to working with those groups to resolve conflicts as they arise. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 7
