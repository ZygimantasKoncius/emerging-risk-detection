To be eligible to represent a shareholder in a shareholders meeting, the attorney-in-fact must be a shareholder, one of our executive officers or directors or an attorney-at-law. In a publicly held corporation, such as ours, the attorney-in-fact may also be a financial institution. Subject to the provisions of the Brazilian Corporate Law and our by-laws, our Board of Directors may ordinarily call our shareholders meetings. These meetings may also be called by: · the Fiscal Council, if the Board of Directors fails to call a general shareholders meeting within one calendar month after the date it was required to do so under applicable laws or a special shareholders meeting in the case of serious and 106 Table of Contents urgent matters affecting us; any shareholder, whenever the executive officers fail to call the meeting of shareholders within 60 days of being required to do so by the Brazilian Corporate Law or by our by-laws; and · shareholders holding at least five percent of our capital stock, if our Board of Directors fails to call a meeting within eight days after receipt of a request from that shareholder to call the meeting that indicates the issues to be discussed or calls for the creation of the Fiscal Council.

Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, directors of a corporation generally have certain duties equivalent to those imposed under the laws of most states of the United States, including a duty of loyalty to the corporation, a duty to refrain from self dealing and a duty to use reasonable care in the management of the corporations affairs. Our directors and officers may be held liable for breaches of duty to us and our shareholders and may be subject to judicial actions in proceedings brought by government agencies or our shareholders. There are no provisions in our by-laws with respect to (i) a directors power to vote on proposals or contracts in which such director is materially interested, (ii) borrowing powers exercisable by the directors, (iii) age limits for retirement of board members, and (iv) number of shares required for director qualification. The chairman and vice-chairman of our Board of Directors are chosen by our Board of Directors at its first meeting following the election of the board members. The vice chairman of our Board of Directors will act as a temporary replacement for our chairman when the chairman is absent or impeded from exercising his functions. Our shareholders have the responsibility of setting the remuneration of the board members at the General Meeting of Stockholders at which the board members are elected. Rights of Shareholders We extend to our shareholders all of the rights that are provided under Brazilian law. Our by-laws are in compliance with the Brazilian Corporate Law. Essential Rights Article 109 of the Brazilian Corporate Law provides that a corporation may not deny certain rights to its shareholders under any circumstances. These shareholders rights include: · the right to have a share of the corporations earnings; · the right to have a share of the corporations assets, in the event of liquidation thereof; · the right to supervise our management according to the Brazilian Corporate Law; · preemptive rights to subscribe new shares or securities convertible into shares, except for exceptions provided by the Brazilian Corporate Law and our by-laws; and · the right to withdraw from the company under certain circumstances provided in the Brazilian Corporate Law. Voting Rights As a general rule, only our common shares are entitled to vote and each common share corresponds to one vote. Holders of preferred shares acquire voting rights if, during three consecutive fiscal years, we fail to pay a fixed or minimum dividend to which 108 Table of Contents the preferred shares are entitled. If a holder of preferred shares acquires voting rights in this manner, such rights will be identical to the voting rights of a holder of common shares and will continue until the dividend is paid. No restrictions exist on the right of a holder of common shares or preferred shares to exercise voting rights with respect to such shares by virtue of such holder being a non-resident of Brazil or a citizen of a country other than Brazil. However, holders of Preferred ADSs may only vote the underlying preferred shares through the depositary according to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, and holders of Common ADSs may only vote the underlying common shares through the depositary according to the terms of the Common ADS Deposit Agreement. In any circumstance in which holders of preferred shares are entitled to vote, each preferred share will entitle its holder to one vote. Redemption Rights Our common shares and preferred shares are not redeemable, except that a dissenting shareholder is entitled under Brazilian Corporate Law to obtain redemption upon a decision made at a shareholders meeting by shareholders representing at least 50% of the voting shares: to create a new class of preferred shares or to disproportionately increase an existing class of preferred shares relative to the other classes of shares (unless such actions are provided for or authorized by the by-laws); to modify a preference, privilege or condition of redemption or amortization conferred on one or more classes of preferred shares, or to create a new class with greater privileges than the existing classes of preferred shares; to reduce the mandatory distribution of dividends; to change our corporate purposes; to merge us with another company or consolidate us; to transfer all of our shares to another company in order to make us a wholly-owned subsidiary of such company; to approve the acquisition of control of another company at a price that exceeds certain limits set forth in Brazilian Corporate Law; to approve our participation in a centralized group of companies as defined under Brazilian Corporate Law; or in the event that the entity resulting from (a) a merger, (b) a transfer of shares as described in clause (6) above or (c) a spin-off that we conduct fails to become a listed company within 120 days of the shareholders meeting at which such decision was taken. Only holders of shares adversely affected by the changes mentioned in items (1) and (2) above may require us to redeem their shares. The right of redemption mentioned in items (5), (6) and (8) above may only be exercised if our shares do not satisfy certain tests of liquidity at the time of the shareholder resolution. The right of redemption lapses 30 days after publication of the minutes of the relevant shareholders meeting, unless, in the case of items (1) and (2) above, the resolution is subject to confirmation by the preferred shareholders (which must be made at a special meeting to be held within one year), in which case the 30-day term is counted from the publication of the minutes of the special meeting. We would be entitled to reconsider any action giving rise to redemption rights within 10 days following the expiration of such rights if the redemption of shares of dissenting shareholders would jeopardize our financial stability. Law No. 9,457 dated May 5, 1997, which amended Brazilian Corporate Law, contains provisions which, among other provisions, restrict redemption rights in certain cases and allow companies to redeem their shares at their economic value, subject to certain requirements. Our by-laws currently do not provide that our capital stock will be redeemable at its economic value and, consequently, any redemption pursuant to Brazilian Corporate Law would be made at no less than the book value per share, determined on the basis of the last balance sheet approved by the shareholders; provided that if the general shareholders meeting giving rise to redemption rights occurred more than 60 days after the date of the last approved balance sheet, a shareholder would be entitled to demand that his or her shares be valued on the basis of a new balance sheet dated within 60 days of such general shareholders meeting. Rights of Minority Shareholders The Brazilian Corporate Law provides that shareholders who own at least 5% of the capital stock of a corporation are afforded the following rights, among others: 109 Table of Contents · the right to require that the books of the corporation be made available for review, whenever these shareholders become suspicious that Brazilian law or the corporations by-laws have been violated, or that irregularities have been committed by the management of the corporation; · the right to call a general meeting of shareholders, under certain circumstances, whenever the corporations directors or officers, as the case may be, fail to do so; and · the right to file an action for indemnification by directors or officers, as the case may be, for damages caused to the assets of the corporation, whenever it is determined at the general meeting of shareholders that such a claim shall not be filed. Minority shareholders that own, individually or in the aggregate, our outstanding common shares (since at least 10% of our outstanding common shares are held by minority shareholders), and also holders of our preferred shares, have the right to appoint one member of the Fiscal Council and an alternate. All shareholders have the right to attend general meetings of shareholders. The Brazilian Corporate Law also provides that minority shareholders that hold either (i) preferred shares representing at least 10% of the total share capital of a company or (ii) common shares representing at least 15% of the voting capital of a company, have the right to appoint one member and an alternate to the Board of Directors. If no common or preferred shareholder meets these thresholds, shareholders holding preferred shares or common shares representing at least 10% of the total share capital of the company are entitled to combine their holdings to appoint one member and an alternate to the Board of Directors. Changes in Rights of Shareholders Any change with respect to the rights of holders of our common shares or preferred shares requires a shareholders meeting. Under the Brazilian Corporate Law, the proposed changes must be approved by a majority of the affected class. Certain changes with respect to the rights of non-voting shares, including preferred shares, such as a change in payment or voting rights, may give rise to the exercise of redemption rights by the holders of the affected shares. Going Private Transactions and Delisting from the BM&FBovespa Our delisting, as a public company, must be preceded by a tender offer by our controlling shareholders or ourselves for the acquisition of all our then outstanding shares, subject to the conditions below: · the price offered for the shares under the public offering must be the fair value of those shares, as established in Brazilian Corporate Law; and · shareholders holding more than two thirds of our float shares shall have expressly agreed to our decision to become a private company or accepted the offer. According to Brazilian Corporate Law, a fair price shall be at least be equal to our valuation, as determined by one or more of the following valuation methods: book value, net book value assessed by market price, discounted cash flow, multiples, price of our shares in the market or any other valuation method accepted by the CVM. This price of the offer may be revised if challenged within 15 days of its publication by holders of at least 10% of our outstanding shares, by means of a request sent to our management that a special shareholders` meeting be called to decide on whether to request a new valuations under the same or different valuation method. Our shareholders that request a new valuation and those who approve such request shall reimburse us for incurred costs if the new valuation is lower than the challenged valuation. However, if the second valuation is higher, the offeror will have the option to continue the offer with the new price or quit the offer. Arbitration Pursuant to the Brazilian Corporate Law and related regulations, if provided for in a companys by-laws, disputes among shareholders will be subject to arbitration. Our by-laws currently do not provide for arbitration. Material Contracts For information concerning our material contracts, see 
