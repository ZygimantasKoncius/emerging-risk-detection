Item 1. BUSINESS Checkpoint Systems, Inc. is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of integrated system solutions for retail security, labeling and merchandising. We provide technology-driven integrated supply chain solutions to brand, track, and secure goods for retailers and consumer product manufacturers worldwide. Retailers and manufacturers have become increasingly focused on identifying and protecting assets that are moving through the supply chain. To address this market opportunity, we have built the necessary infrastructure to be a single source for identification and shrink management solutions worldwide. We are a leading provider of electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems and tags using radio frequency (RF) and electromagnetic (EM) technology, security source tagging, branding tags and labels for apparel, retail display systems (RDS), and hand-held labeling systems (HLS). Our labeling systems and services are designed to consolidate tag and label requirements to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and furnish value-added solutions for customers across many markets and industries. Applications for printed tags and labels include brand identification, automatic identification (auto-ID), retail security, and pricing and promotional labels. We have achieved substantial international growth, primarily through acquisitions, and now operate directly in 31 countries. Products are principally developed and manufactured in-house and sold through direct distribution and reseller channels. COMPANY HISTORY Founded in 1969, we were incorporated in Pennsylvania as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Logistics Industries Corporation (Logistics). In 1977, Logistics, pursuant to the terms of its merger into Lydall, Inc., distributed our common stock to Logistics shareholders as a dividend. Historically, we have expanded our business both domestically and internationally through acquisitions, internal growth using wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the utilization of independent distributors. In 1993 and 1995, we completed two key acquisitions which gave us direct access into Western Europe. We acquired ID Systems International BV and ID Systems Europe BV in 1993 and Actron Group Limited in 1995. These companies engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of EAS systems throughout Europe. 4 Table of Contents In December 1999, we acquired Meto AG, a German multinational corporation and a leading provider of value-added labeling solutions for article identification and security. The acquisition doubled our revenues and provided us with an increased breadth of product offerings and global reach. In January 2001, we acquired A.W. Printing Inc., a Houston, Texas-based printer of tags, labels, and packaging material for the apparel industry. In January 2006, we completed the sale of our barcode systems business to SATO, a global leader in barcode printing, labeling, and Electronic Product Code (EPC)/Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) solutions. In November 2006, we acquired ADS Worldwide (ADS). Based in Hull, England, ADS is an established supplier of tags, labels and trim to apparel manufacturers, retailers and brands around the world. ADS provides us with new technological and production capabilities and is in line with our strategy to grow our CheckNet® service bureau business to create increased value for our customers and stockholders. Products and Offerings Our products and services are organized into three operating segments: security, labeling services, and retail merchandising. Each segment offers an assortment of products and services that in combination are designed to provide a comprehensive, single source solution to help retailers, manufacturers, and distributors identify, track, and protect their assets throughout the entire supply chain. Each segment and their respective products and services are described below. SECURITY Our largest business is retail security. Our Companys diversified security product lines are designed to help retailers prevent inventory losses caused by theft (both by customers and employees) and reduce selling costs through lower staff requirements. Our products facilitate the open display of consumer goods, which allows retailers to maximize sales opportunities through impulse buying. Offering our own proprietary RF-EAS and EM-EAS technologies, we believe that we hold a significant share of worldwide EAS installations. EAS revenues accounted for 56%, 58%, and 55% of our 2006, 2005, and 2004 total revenues, respectively. Systems for closed-circuit television (CCTV), fire and intrusion, and access control also fall within the security business segment. For 2006, 2005, and 2004, the CCTV business represented 17%, 17%, and 20% of our revenues, respectively. No other product group in this segment accounted for as much as 10% of our revenues. These broad and flexible product lines, marketed and serviced by our extensive sales and service organizations, have helped us emerge as a preferred supplier to premier retailers around the world. Retail security represented approximately 73% of total revenues in 2006. Electronic Article Surveillance EAS systems have been designed to act as a deterrent to control the problem of merchandise theft in retail stores and libraries. Our diversified product lines are designed to help reduce both customer and employee theft, reduce inventory shrinkage, and enable retailers to capitalize on consumer impulse buying by openly displaying high-margin and high-cost items. We offer a wide variety of RF-EAS and EM-EAS solutions to meet the varied requirements of retail store configurations for multiple market segments worldwide. Our EAS systems are primarily comprised of sensors and deactivation units, which respond to or act upon our tags and labels. We also market an extensive line of reusable security tags that protect apparel items as well as entertainment products. Under our source tagging program, tags can be embedded in products or packaging at the point-of-manufacture. Our EAS products are designed and built to comply with applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Community (EC) regulations governing radio frequencies (RF), signal strengths, and other factors. CCTV, Fire and Intrusion Systems We offer a broad line of closed-circuit television products providing a high-value systems solution package for retail environments. Our video surveillance solutions, including digital video technology, address shoplifting and internal theft as well as customer and employee safety and security needs. The product line consists of fixed and high-speed pan/tilt/zoom camera systems, programmable switcher controls, time-lapse recording, and remote video surveillance. 5 Table of Contents Our fire and intrusion systems provide life safety and property protection, completing the line of loss prevention solutions. In addition to the system installations, we offer a U.S.-based 24-hour Central Station Monitoring Service. Access Control Systems In 2005 we signed an agreement to divest our Access Control business to better position us for future growth in our core business segments. This business, which represented less than 1% of our revenues, was divested on December 31, 2005. LABELING SERVICES Labeling services is our second largest business, generating approximately 15% of our revenues in 2006. All participants in the retail supply chain are concerned with maximizing efficiency. Reducing time-to-market requires refined production and logistics systems to ensure just-in-time delivery, as well as shorter development, design, and production cycles. Services range from full-color branding labels to tracking labels and, ultimately, fully-integrated labels that include an EAS or a RFID circuit. This integration is based on the critical objective of supporting the rapid delivery of goods to market while reducing losses, whether through misdirection, tracking failure, theft or counterfeiting, and to reduce labor costs by tagging and labeling products at the source. We support these objectives with our high-quality tag and label production, a global service bureau network of e-commerce-enabled capabilities (Check-Net®), and EAS and RFID technologies. Increasingly, the market is moving toward more sophisticated tag solutions that incorporate RFID components and that will automate many aspects of supply chain tracking and facilitate many new merchandising enhancements for suppliers and consumers. Check-Net® revenues represented 13%, 9%, and 9% of our total revenues for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. No other product in this segment represented more than 10% of revenues. Check-Net® (Service Bureau) We operate a global service bureau network of more than 30 locations worldwide which supplies customers with customized retail apparel tags and labels, typically to the location where the retail goods are manufactured. A service bureau imprints variable pricing and article identification data and barcoding information onto price and apparel branding tags. Check-Nets® web-enabled capabilities provide on-time, on-demand printing of custom labels with variable data. Our Check-Net® service bureau network is one of the most extensive in the industry, and its ability to offer integrated branding, barcode, and EAS security tags places it among just a handful of suppliers of this caliber in the world. CheckNets® printing capacity and service bureau network expanded in November 2006 with the acquisition of ADS. In addition to our own label integration and service bureau capabilities, we have strategic working relationships with other label integrators. Intelligent Library Systems We have established a product line of sophisticated RFID-based intelligent library solutions that offer strong features and benefits compared to competitive offerings. Our Intelligent Library System®, which was released in 1999, is currently installed in more than 125 libraries in the U.S.. RFID Tags and Labels The company has a RFID initiative aimed at positioning Checkpoint as a quality producer of RFID tags and labels, leveraging its high volume, low cost RF circuit production and manufacturing knowledge. In October 2006, we announced our intention to focus our RFID initiative on our core retail customers and our existing library business. 6 Table of Contents RETAIL MERCHANDISING Retail merchandising includes hand-held label applicators and tags, promotional displays, and queuing systems. These traditional products broaden our reach among retailers. Many of the products in this business segment represent high-margin items with a high level of recurring sales of associated consumables such as labels. As a result of the increasing use of scanning technology in retail, our HLS products are serving a declining market. Retail merchandising, which is focused on European and Asian markets, represents approximately 12% of our business, with no product group in this segment accounting for as much as 10% of our revenues. Hand-held Labeling Systems Hand-held labeling systems include a complete line of hand-held price marking and label application solutions, primarily sold to retailers. Sales of labels, consumables, and service generate a significant source of recurring revenues. As retail scanning becomes widespread, in-store retail price marking applications have continued to decline. Our HLS products currently have a majority market share in Europe. Retail Display Systems Retail display systems include a wide range of products for customers in certain retail sectors, such as supermarkets and do-it-yourself (DIY), where high-quality signage and in-store price promotion are important. Product categories include traditional retail promotional systems for in-store communication and electronic graphics systems, and customer queuing systems. These systems are no longer sold in the U.S. as a result of the divesture to SATO in January 2006. BUSINESS STRATEGY Our business strategy focuses on providing comprehensive, single-source solutions that help retailers, manufacturers, and distributors identify, track, and protect their assets. We believe that innovative new products and expanded product offerings will provide significant opportunities to enhance the value of legacy products while expanding the product base in existing customer accounts. We intend to maintain our leadership position in certain key hard goods markets, expand our market share in the soft goods markets, and maximize our position in under-penetrated markets. We also intend to continue to capitalize on our installed base of large global retailers to promote source tagging. Furthermore, we plan to leverage our knowledge of RF and identification technologies to assist retailers and manufacturers in realizing the benefits of RFID. To achieve these objectives, we plan to work to continually enhance and expand our technologies and products, and provide superior service to our customers. We are focused on providing our customers with a wide variety of integrated shrink management, labeling, and retail merchandising solutions characterized by superior quality, ease of use, good value, and enhanced merchandising opportunities for the retailer, manufacturer, and distributor. To improve profitability, we initiated an evaluation of our business lines and operations globally in order to develop a plan to dramatically improve operating margins, shareholder value, and customer focus. This evaluation resulted in the exiting of underperforming businesses, including BCS and Access Control, and other actions designed to improve sales productivity, reconfigure our manufacturing and supply chain, and rationalize our overhead structure. Principal Markets and Marketing Strategy Through our security business segment, we market EAS and CCTV products primarily to worldwide retailers in the hard goods market (supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and music/electronics), soft goods market (apparel), libraries, and consumer product manufacturers through our source tagging program. We enjoy significant market share, particularly in the supermarket, drug store, hypermarket, and mass merchandiser market segments. Some of our diverse worldwide customers include: Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Circuit City Stores, CVS/pharmacy, Esprit, GAP/Old Navy, Home Depot, Kohls Department Stores, Linens n Things, Sears, Target Corporation, Walgreen Co., and Winn Dixie, Inc. in the U.S.; Safeway and Shoppers Drug Mart/Pharmaprix in Canada; Gigante in Mexico; Pague Menos in Brazil; B&Q in the United Kingdom; Alcampo, Carrefour, El Corte Inglés, and Mercadona in Spain; Carrefour, Casino, FNAC, and Intermarché in France; Metro Group in Germany; Woolworths in Australia; Don Quixote in Japan; and Ahold throughout Europe. 7 Table of Contents Shoplifting and employee theft are major causes of shrinkage. Data collection systems have highlighted the shrinkage problem to retailers. As a result, retailers recognize that the implementation of effective electronic security solutions can significantly reduce shrinkage and increase profitability. In addition to providing retail security solutions, we provide a wide variety of integrated shrink management, labeling services, and retail merchandising solutions to manufacturers and retailers worldwide. This entails a broadened focus within the entire retail supply chain by providing branding, tracking, and shrink management solutions to retail stores, distribution centers, and consumer product and apparel manufacturers worldwide. We are focused on providing our customers with a wide variety of integrated solutions to help them Sell More and Lose Less. Our ongoing marketing strategy includes the following:  open new, and expand, existing retail accounts with new products that will increase penetration through integrated value-added solutions for labeling, security, and merchandising;  establish business-to-business web-based capabilities to enable retailers and manufacturers to initiate and track their orders through the supply chain on a global basis;  expand market opportunities to manufacturers and distributors, including source tagging and value-added labeling;  continue to promote source tagging around the world with extensive integration and automation capabilities using new EAS, RFID, and auto-ID technologies; and  assist retailers in understanding the benefits and implementation of the new Electronic Product Code (EPC) using RFID technology. We market our products primarily:  by providing total loss prevention solutions to the retailer;  by helping retailers sell more merchandise by avoiding stock-outs and making merchandise available to consumers;  by serving as a single point of contact for auto-ID and EAS labeling and ticketing needs;  through direct sales efforts and targeted trade show participation;  through superior service and support capabilities; and  by emphasizing source tagging benefits. We focus on partnering with retail suppliers worldwide in our source tagging program. Ongoing strategies to increase acceptance of source tagging are as follows:  increase installation of EAS equipment on a chain-wide basis with leading retailers around the world;  offer integrated tag solutions, including custom tag conversion that addresses the needs of branding, tracking, and loss prevention;  assist retailers in promoting source tagging with vendors;  broaden penetration of existing accounts by promoting our in-house printing, global service bureau network (Check-Net®), and labeling solution capabilities;  support manufacturers and suppliers to speed implementation;  expand RF tag technologies and products to accommodate the needs of the packaging industry; and  develop compatibility with EPC/RFID technologies. 8 Table of Contents Manufacturing, Raw Materials, and Inventory Electronic Article Surveillance We manufacture our EAS products in facilities located in Puerto Rico, Japan, Germany, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, and the Netherlands. Our manufacturing strategy for EAS products is to rely primarily on in-house capability and to vertically integrate manufacturing operations to the extent economically beneficial. This integration and in-house capability provides significant control over costs, quality, and responsiveness to market demand, which we believe results in a distinct competitive advantage. We involve customers, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing in the design and development of our products. For RF sensor production, we purchase raw materials from outside suppliers and assemble electronic components at our facilities in the Dominican Republic for the majority of our sensor product lines. The manufacture of some RF sensors sold in Europe and all EM hardware is outsourced. For our EAS disposable tag production, we purchase raw materials and components from suppliers and complete the manufacturing process at our facilities in Puerto Rico, Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands. We sold approximately 3.5 billion disposable tags in 2006 and have the capacity to produce more than 5 billion disposable tags per year. The principal raw materials and components used by us in the manufacture of our products are electronic components and circuit boards for our systems; and aluminum foil, resins, paper, and ferric chloride solutions for our disposable tags. While most of these materials are purchased from several suppliers, there are alternative sources for all such materials. The products that are not manufactured by us are sub-contracted to manufacturers selected for their manufacturing and assembly skills, quality, and price. CCTV, Fire and Intrusion Systems We are primarily an integrator of CCTV, fire and intrusion components manufactured by others. In the U.S., we use in-house capabilities to assemble products such as the pan/tilt/zoom dome camera and other products such as the Advanced Public View (APV) CCTV system. The software component of the system is added during product assembly at our operational facilities. Labeling Services and Retail Merchandising We manufacture labels, tags, and hand-held tools. Our main production facilities are located in Germany, the Netherlands, the U.S., and Malaysia. Local production facilities are also situated in Hong Kong. Manufacturing in Germany is focused on HLS labels and print heads for HLS tools. Our facilities in the Netherlands and in the U.S. manufacture labels and tags for laser overprinting, thermal labels. The Malaysian facility produces standard bodies for HLS tools for Europe, complete hand-held tools for the rest of the world, and labels for the local market. With the acquisition of ADS in November 2006, we acquired label manufacturing facilities in the UK, Hong Kong, China, and Turkey. DISTRIBUTION For our major product lines, we principally sell our products to end customers using our direct sales force of more than 450 sales people. To improve our sales efficiency, we also distribute products through an independent network of resellers. This distribution channel supports and services smaller customers. This indirect channel, which has primarily sold EAS solutions, will be broadened and expanded to include more product lines as we focus on improved sales productivity. Electronic Article Surveillance We sell our EAS systems principally throughout North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. In North America, we market our EAS products through our own sales personnel and independent representatives. During 2006, 93% of total U.S. EAS revenues were generated by our own sales personnel. Internationally, we market our EAS products principally through foreign subsidiaries which sell directly to the end-user and through independent distributors. Our international sales operations are currently located in 16 European countries and in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Malaysia, China, Mexico, Turkey and New Zealand. 9 Table of Contents Foreign distributors sell our products to both the retail and library markets. Pursuant to written distribution agreements, we generally appoint an independent distributor as an exclusive distributor for a specified term and for a specified territory. CCTV, Fire and Intrusion Systems We market CCTV systems and services in selected countries throughout the world using our own sales staff. These products and services are provided to our EAS retail customers, as well as non-EAS retailers. Fire and intrusion systems are marketed exclusively in the U.S. through a direct sales force. Labeling Services and Retail Merchandising We have customers worldwide in the labeling services and retail merchandising businesses. These customers are primarily found within the retail sector and retail supply chain. Major customers include companies within industries such as food retailing, DIY (Do-It-Yourself), department stores, and apparel retailers. Large national and international customers are handled centrally by key account sales specialists supported by appropriate business specialists. Smaller customers are served by either a general sales force capable of representing all products or, if the complexity or size of the business demands, a dedicated business specialist. BACKLOG Our backlog of orders was approximately $54.9 million at December 31, 2006 compared to approximately $52.2 million at December 25, 2005. We anticipate that substantially all of the backlog at the end of 2006 will be delivered during 2007. In the opinion of management, the amount of backlog is not indicative of trends in our business. Our security business generally follows the retail cycle so that revenues are weighted toward the last half of the calendar year as retailers prepare for the holiday season. TECHNOLOGY We believe that our patented and proprietary technologies are important to our business and future growth opportunities, and provide us with distinct competitive advantages. We continually evaluate our domestic and international patent portfolio, and where the cost of maintaining the patent exceeds its value, such patent may not be renewed. The majority of our revenues are derived from products or technologies which are patented or licensed. There can be no assurance, however, that a competitor could not develop products comparable to those of the Company. Our competitive position is also supported by our extensive manufacturing experience and know-how. Patents & Licensing On October 1, 1995, we acquired certain patents and improvements thereon related to EAS products and manufacturing processes from Arthur D. Little, Inc. for which we pay annual royalties. We also license technologies relating to RFID applications, EAS Products, certain sensors, magnetic labels, and fluid tags. These license arrangements have various expiration dates and royalty terms, but are not considered by us to be material. Labeling Services and Retail Merchandising We focus our in-house development efforts on product areas where we believe we can achieve and sustain a competitive cost and positioning advantage, and where delivery service is critical. We also develop and maintain technological expertise in areas that are believed to be important for new product development in our principal business areas. We have a base of technology expertise in the printing, electronics, and software areas and are particularly focused on EAS and labeling capabilities to support the development of higher value-added labels. SEASONALITY Our business is subject to seasonal influences, which generally causes us to realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year. Our business seasonality substantially follows the retail cycle of our customers, which generally has revenues weighted towards the last half of the calendar year in preparation for the holiday season. 10 Table of Contents COMPETITION Electronic Article Surveillance Currently, EAS systems are sold to two principal markets: retail establishments and libraries. Our principal global competitor in the EAS industry is Tyco International Ltd., through its ADT security division. Tyco is a diversified manufacturing and service company with interests in electronics, fire and security, healthcare, plastics and adhesives, and engineered products and services. Tycos 2006 revenues were approximately $41.0 billion. Within the U.S. market, additional competitors include Sentry Technology Corporation and Ketec, Inc., principally in the retail market, and 3M Company, principally in the library market. Within our international markets, mainly Europe, NEDAP and Tyco are our most significant competitors. We believe that our product line offers a more diverse range of products than our competition with a variety of disposable and reusable tags and labels, integrated scan/deactivation capabilities, and RF source tagging embedded into products or packaging. As a result, we compete in marketing our products primarily on the basis of their versatility, reliability, affordability, accuracy, and integration into operations. This combination provides many system solutions and allows for protection against a variety of retail merchandise theft. Furthermore, we believe that our manufacturing know-how and efficiencies relating to disposable tags give us a cost advantage over our competitors. CCTV, Fire and Intrusion Systems Our CCTV, fire and intrusion products, which are sold domestically through our Checkpoint Security Systems Group subsidiary and internationally through our international sales subsidiaries, compete primarily with similar products offered by Pelco and Tyco. We compete based on our superior service and believe that our offerings provide our retail and non-retail customers with distinctive system features. Global Labeling Services We sell our labeling services, including tags and labels, to the retail market. Major competitors for our label products are Avery Dennison and Paxar. Several competitive labeling service companies are also customers as they purchase EAS circuits from us to integrate into their label offerings. Retail Merchandising We face no single competitor across our entire retail merchandising product range or across all international markets. HL Display is our largest competitor in the retail display systems market, primarily in Europe. In the HLS segment, we compete with Contact, Garvey, Hallo, Paxar, and Prix. OTHER MATTERS Research and Development We spent approximately $19.4 million, $19.1 million, and $28.5 million, in research and development activities during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The emphasis of these activities is the continued broadening of the product lines offered by us, cost reductions of the current product lines, and an expansion of the markets and applications for our products. We believe that our future growth in revenues will be dependent, in part, on the products and technologies resulting from these efforts. Another important source of new products and technologies has been the acquisition of companies and products. We continue to assess acquisitions of related businesses or products consistent with our overall product and marketing strategies. We continue to develop and expand our product lines with improvements in disposable tag performance, disposable tag manufacturing processes, and wide-aisle RF-EAS detection sensors with integration of remote and wireless internet connectivity and RFID integration. 11 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 3,213 employees, including six executive officers, 90 employees engaged in research and development activities, and 535 employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. In the United States, 10 of our employees are represented by a union. In Europe, we believe that approximately 500 of our employees are represented by various unions or work councils. Financial Information About Geographic and Business Segments We operate both domestically and internationally in the three distinct business segments described previously.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The following risk factors, among other possible factors, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results: (1) changes in international business conditions; We are a multinational manufacturer and marketer of integrated system solutions for retail security, labeling, and merchandising. Our international operations account for approximately 63% of our revenues. Our results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in foreign economic conditions generally or in markets served. (2) foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and competitive factors in the countries in which we operate, could affect our revenues, expenses and results of operations. (3) lower than anticipated demand by retailers and other customers for our products, particularly in the current economic environment; Our business is heavily dependent on the retail marketplace. Changes to the economic environment or reductions in retailer spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. (4) slower commitments of retail customers to chain-wide installations and/or source tagging adoption or expansion; Our revenues are dependent on our ability to maintain and increase our system installation base. The system installation base leads to additional revenues, which we term as recurring revenues, through the sale of tags and maintenance services. In addition, we partner with manufacturers to include our sensor tags into the product during manufacturing. 13 Table of Contents If the commitment for chain-wide installation declines or the adoption or expansion of our source tag program does not occur, it could have an adverse affect on our revenues and results of operations. (5) possible increases in per unit product manufacturing costs due to less than full utilization of manufacturing capacity as a result of slowing economic conditions or other factors; Our manufacturing capacity is designed to meet our current and future anticipated demands. If our product demand decreases as a result of economic conditions and other factors, it could increase our cost per unit and affect our cost of sales and results of operations. (6) our ability to provide and market innovative and cost-effective products; We operate in competitive markets which are sensitive to price. Our ability to provide cost-effective products could affect our customer demand. (7) the development of new competitive technologies; Our long term success will depend on transitioning from existing technologies into the next generation of technology. While we are investigating and investing in potential replacement technologies such as radio frequency identification, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining our current market position in the future. (8) our ability to maintain our intellectual property; We have a number of patents that will be expiring in the next several years. The expiration of these patents will reduce the barriers to entry into our existing lines of business and may result in loss of market share. (9) competitive pricing pressures causing profit erosion; We operate in highly competitive business segments. If pricing in any of these segments were to decrease due to competitive pressures, it could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. (10) the availability and pricing of component parts and raw materials; Our ability to grow earnings will be affected by increases in the cost of component parts and raw materials, including electronic components, circuit boards, aluminum foil, resins, paper, and ferric chloride solutions. We may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher component parts and raw material costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. (11) possible increases in the payment time for receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors; The majority of our customer base is in the retail marketplace. A material change in the economic condition of this sector or other sectors served by us could have a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated cash from operations. (12) changes in regulations or standards applicable to our products; Our EAS products are subject to FCC regulation and equivalent regulatory oversight in Europe. While we continually monitor potential changes, any change could affect our ability to compete in that market. (13) the ability to implement cost reduction in field service, sales, and general and administrative expense, and our manufacturing and supply chain operations without significantly impacting revenue and profits; and We are in the process of taking actions to rationalize our field service, improve our sales productivity, reduce our general and administrative expenses, and reconfigure our manufacturing and supply chain operations. While we will monitor the progress, our ability to execute the changes to these areas could have an impact on future revenues and profits. (14) material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting, and other aspects of our business. 14 Table of Contents The maintenance of an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. In March 2007, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended 2004 and 2005, and the four quarterly periods in 2005 and the first three quarters in 2006. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that is described in Item 9A of this report. As a result of this material weakness, managements assessment concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. The material weakness has not been fully addressed. It is also possible that additional material weaknesses will be identified in the future. Until we complete the remediation of the material weakness, we risk material misstatements to the annual or interim financial statements that are not prevented or detected on a timely basis. The current material weakness or any future weaknesses or internal control deficiencies could hurt confidence in our business and consolidated financial statements, impacting our ability to do business with customers, investors, securities analysts, investors and others.
