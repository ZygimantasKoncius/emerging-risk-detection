ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There are many factors that may affect our business and results of operations. Additional discussion regarding factors that may affect our businesses and operating results is included elsewhere in this Report. Risks Related to Our Business Decreases in the demand for propane because of warmer-than-normal heating season weather or unfavorable weather may adversely affect our results of operations. Because many of our customers rely on propane as a heating fuel, our results of operations are adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the volume of propane sold is at its highest during the five-month peak heating season of November through March and is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather. For example, historically approximately 55% to 60% of our annual retail propane volumes are sold during these months. There can be no assurance that normal winter weather in our service territories will occur in the future. The agricultural demand for propane is also affected by weather, as dry or warm weather during the harvest season may reduce the demand for propane. Our ACE operations experience higher volumes in the spring and summer, mainly due to the grilling season. Sustained periods of unfavorable weather conditions can negatively affect our ACE revenues. Unfavorable weather conditions may also cause a reduction in the purchase and use of grills and other propane-filled appliances which could reduce the demand for our portable propane tank exchange services. 9 Table of Contents Our profitability is subject to propane pricing and inventory risk. The retail propane business is a margin-based business in which gross profits are dependent upon the excess of the sales price over the propane supply costs. Propane is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control over these market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the propane that we and other marketers purchase can change rapidly over a short period of time. Most of our propane product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major storage points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas or Conway, Kansas. Because our profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale propane supply costs, it will be adversely affected if we cannot pass on increases in the cost of propane to our customers. Due to competitive pricing in the industry, we may not be able to pass on product cost increases to our customers when product costs rise rapidly, or when our competitors do not raise their product prices. Finally, market volatility may cause us to sell inventory at less than the price we purchased it, which would adversely affect our operating results. High propane prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product. Prices for propane are subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. During periods of high propane costs such as those experienced in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, our prices generally increase. High prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product. Supplier defaults may have a negative effect on our operating results. When we enter into fixed-price sales contracts with customers, we also enter into fixed-price purchase contracts with suppliers. Depending on changes in the market prices of products compared to the prices secured in our contracts with suppliers of propane, a default of one or more of our suppliers under such contracts could cause us to purchase propane at higher prices which would have a negative impact on our operating results. Changes in commodity market prices may have a negative effect on our liquidity. Depending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers, a change in the market price of propane could create a margin payment obligation for us and expose us to an increased liquidity risk. Our operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources. Propane competes with other sources of energy, some of which are less costly on an equivalent energy basis. In addition, we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our operations. We compete for customers against suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas. Electricity is a major competitor of propane, but propane generally enjoys a competitive price advantage over electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Fuel oil is also a major competitor of propane and is generally less expensive than propane. Furnaces and appliances that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil and vice versa, and, therefore, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Our customers generally have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than propane. Except for certain industrial and commercial applications, propane is generally not competitive with natural gas in areas where natural gas pipelines already exist because natural gas is generally a less expensive source of energy than propane. The gradual expansion of the nations natural gas distribution systems has resulted, and may continue to result, in the availability of natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon propane. 10 Table of Contents Our ability to increase revenues is adversely affected by the maturity of the retail propane industry. The retail propane industry is mature, with only modest growth in total demand for the product foreseen. Given this limited growth, we expect that year-to-year industry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our ability to grow within the industry is dependent on our ability to acquire other retail distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes expansion of our ACE and Strategic Accounts programs, as well as the success of our marketing programs designed to attract and retain customers. Any failure to retain and grow our customer base would have an adverse effect on our results. Our ability to grow will be adversely affected if we are not successful in making acquisitions or integrating the acquisitions we have made. We have historically expanded our propane business through acquisitions. We regularly consider and evaluate opportunities for growth through the acquisition of local, regional and national propane distributors. We may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. We can give no assurances that we will find attractive acquisition candidates in the future, that we will be able to acquire such candidates on economically acceptable terms, that any acquisitions will not be dilutive to earnings and distributions or that any additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition will not affect our ability to make distributions. To the extent we are successful in making acquisitions, such acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations, difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees and difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations. The failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance. Our operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling, storing, transporting and otherwise providing combustible liquids such as propane for use by consumers. As a result, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance; however, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages and penalties, if any, may not be covered by insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices. 11 Table of Contents We may be unable to respond effectively to competition, which may adversely affect our operating results. We may be unable to timely respond to changes within the propane sector that may result from regulatory initiatives to further increase competition within our industry. Such regulatory initiatives may create opportunities for additional competitors to enter our markets, and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain our revenues or continue to pursue our current business strategy. Our net income will decrease if we are required to incur additional costs to comply with new governmental safety, health, transportation and environmental regulations. We are subject to various federal, state and local safety, health, transportation and environmental laws and regulations governing the storage, distribution and transportation of propane. We have implemented safety and environmental programs and policies designed to avoid potential liability and costs under applicable laws. It is possible, however, that we will incur increased costs as a result of complying with new safety, health, transportation and environmental regulations and that such costs will reduce our net income. It is also possible that material environmental liabilities will be incurred, including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Our Common Units Cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance. Although we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, the amount of cash that we generate each quarter fluctuates. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will pay the current regular quarterly distribution each quarter. Available cash generally means, with respect to any fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of each quarter, plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of the determination of available cash resulting from borrowings after the end of the quarter, less the amount of reserves established to provide for the proper conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law or agreements, or to provide funds for future distributions to partners. The actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors, including:  our cash flow generated by operations;  the weather in our areas of operation;  our borrowing capacity under our bank credit facilities;  required principal and interest payments on our debt;  fluctuations in our working capital;  our cost of acquisitions (including related debt service payments);  restrictions contained in our debt instruments;  our capital expenditures; 12 Table of Contents  our issuances of debt and equity securities;  reserves made by our General Partner in its discretion;  prevailing economic and industry conditions; and  financial, business and other factors, a number of which are beyond our control. Our General Partner has broad discretion to determine the amount of available cash for distribution to holders of our equity securities through the establishment and maintenance of cash reserves, thereby potentially lessening and limiting the amount of available cash eligible for distribution. Our General Partner determines the timing and amount of our distributions and has broad discretion in determining the amount of funds that will be recognized as available cash. Part of this discretion comes from the ability of our General Partner to establish reserves. Decisions as to amounts to be reserved have a direct impact on the amount of available cash for distributions because reserves are taken into account in computing available cash. Each fiscal quarter, our General Partner may, in its reasonable discretion, determine that amounts to be reserved, subject to restrictions on the purposes of the reserves. Reserves may be made, increased or decreased for any proper purpose, including, but not limited to, reserves:  to comply with terms of any of our agreements or obligations, including the establishment of reserves to fund the payment of interest and principal in the future of debt securities;  to provide for level distributions of cash notwithstanding the seasonality of our business; and  to provide for future capital expenditures and other payments deemed by our General Partner to be necessary or advisable. The decision by our General Partner to establish reserves may limit the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our equity securities. Holders of our equity securities will not receive payments unless we are able to first satisfy our own obligations and the establishment of any reserves. Holders of Common Units may experience dilution of their interests. We may issue an unlimited number of additional limited partner interests and other equity securities, including senior equity securities, for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established by our General Partner in its sole discretion, without the approval of any unitholders. We also may issue an unlimited number of partnership interests junior to the Common Units without a unitholder vote. When we issue additional equity securities, a unitholders proportionate partnership interest will decrease and the amount of cash distributed on each unit and the market price of the Common Units could decrease. Issuance of additional Common Units will also diminish the relative limited voting power of each previously outstanding unit. Please read Holders of Common Units have limited voting rights, management and control of us below. The ultimate effect of any such issuance may be to dilute the interests of holders of units in AmeriGas Partners and to make it more difficult for a person or group to remove our General Partner or otherwise change our management. 13 Table of Contents The market price of the Common Units may be adversely affected by various change of management provisions. Our Partnership Agreement contains certain provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our General Partner as general partner or otherwise change the management of AmeriGas Partners. If any person or group other than the General Partner or its affiliates acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Common Units, such person or group will lose its voting rights with respect to all of its Common Units. The effect of these provisions and the change of control provisions in our debt instruments may be to diminish the price at which the Common Units will trade under certain circumstances. Restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations may reduce our operating flexibility. The various agreements governing our and the Operating Partnerships indebtedness and other financing transactions restrict quarterly distributions. These agreements contain various negative and affirmative covenants applicable to us and the Operating Partnership and some of these agreements require us and the Operating Partnership to maintain specified financial ratios. If we or the Operating Partnership violate any of these covenants or requirements, a default may result and distributions would be limited. These covenants limit our and the Operating Partnerships ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness;  engage in transactions with affiliates;  create or incur liens; 14 Table of Contents  sell assets;  make restricted payments, loans and investments;  enter into business combinations and asset sale transactions; and  engage in other lines of business. Holders of Common Units have limited voting rights, management and control of us. Our General Partner manages and operates AmeriGas Partners. Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, holders of outstanding Common Units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business. Holders of Common Units have no right to elect the general partner or its directors, and our General Partner generally may not be removed except pursuant to the vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the outstanding units. In addition, removal of the general partner may result in a default under our debt instruments and loan agreements. As a result, holders of Common Units have limited say in matters affecting our operations and others may find it difficult to attempt to gain control or influence our activities. Holders of Common Units may be required to sell their Common Units against their will. If at any time our General Partner and its affiliates hold 80% or more of the issued and outstanding Common Units, our General Partner will have the right (but not the obligation) to purchase all, but not less than all, of the remaining Common Units held by nonaffiliates at certain specified prices pursuant to the Partnership Agreement. Accordingly, under certain circumstances holders of Common Units may be required to sell their Common Units against their will and the price that they receive for those securities may be less than they would like to receive. They may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their Common Units. Holders of Common Units may not have limited liability in certain circumstances and may be liable for the return of distributions that cause our liabilities to exceed our assets. The limitations on the liability of holders of Common Units for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states. If it were determined that AmeriGas Partners had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute, or that the right or the exercise of the right by the holders of Common Units as a group to remove or replace our General Partner, to make certain amendments to our Partnership Agreement or to take other action pursuant to that Partnership Agreement constituted participation in the control of the business of AmeriGas Partners, then a holder of Common Units could be held liable under certain circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as our General Partner. We are not obligated to inform holders of Common Units about whether we are in compliance with the limited partnership statutes of any states. 15 Table of Contents Holders of Common Units may also have to repay AmeriGas Partners amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Delaware law, we may not make a distribution to holders of Common Units if the distribution causes our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted. Delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount for three years from the distribution date. Our General Partner has conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities, which may permit our General Partner to favor its own interest to the detriment of holders of Common Units. Conflicts of interest can arise as a result of the relationships between AmeriGas Partners, on the one hand, and the General Partner and its affiliates, on the other. The directors and officers of the General Partner have fiduciary duties to manage the General Partner in a manner beneficial to the General Partners sole shareholder, AmeriGas, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of UGI Corporation. At the same time, the General Partner has fiduciary duties to manage AmeriGas Partners in a manner beneficial to both it and the unitholders. The duties of our General Partner to AmeriGas Partners and the unitholders, therefore, may come into conflict with the duties of the directors and officers of our General Partner to its sole shareholder, AmeriGas, Inc. Such conflicts of interest might arise in the following situations, among others:  Decisions of our General Partner with respect to the amount and timing of cash expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional units and reserves in any quarter affect whether and the extent to which there is sufficient available cash from operating surplus to make quarterly distributions in a given quarter. In addition, actions by our General Partner may have the effect of enabling the General Partner to receive distributions that exceed 2% of total distributions.  AmeriGas Partners does not have any employees and relies solely on employees of the General Partner and its affiliates.  Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, we reimburse our General Partner and its affiliates for costs incurred in managing and operating AmeriGas Partners, including costs incurred in rendering corporate staff and support services to us.  Any agreements between us and our General Partner and its affiliates do not grant to the holders of Common Units, separate and apart from AmeriGas Partners, the right to enforce the obligations of our General Partner and such affiliates in our favor. Therefore, the General Partner, in its capacity as the general partner of AmeriGas Partners, is primarily responsible for enforcing such obligations. 16 Table of Contents  Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, our General Partner is not restricted from causing us to pay the General Partner or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of such entities on behalf of AmeriGas Partners. Neither the Partnership Agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us, on the one hand, and the General Partner and its affiliates, on the other, are or will be the result of arms-length negotiations.  Our General Partner may exercise its right to call for and purchase units as provided in the Partnership Agreement or assign such right to one of its affiliates or to us. Our Partnership Agreement expressly permits our General Partner to resolve conflicts of interest between itself or its affiliates, on the one hand, and us or the unitholders, on the other, and to consider, in resolving such conflicts of interest, the interests of other parties in addition to the interests of the unitholders. In addition, the Partnership Agreement provides that a purchaser of Common Units is deemed to have consented to certain conflicts of interest and actions of our General Partner and its affiliates that might otherwise be prohibited and to have agreed that such conflicts of interest and actions do not constitute a breach by the General Partner of any duty stated or implied by law or equity. The General Partner is not in breach of its obligations under the Partnership Agreement or its duties to us or the unitholders if the resolution of such conflict is fair and reasonable to us. The latitude given in the Partnership Agreement to the General Partner in resolving conflicts of interest may significantly limit the ability of a unitholder to challenge what might otherwise be a breach of fiduciary duty. Our Partnership Agreement expressly limits the liability of our General Partner by providing that the General Partner, its affiliates and its officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to us, the limited partners or assignees for errors of judgment or for any actual omissions if the General Partner and other persons acted in good faith. In addition, we are required to indemnify our General Partner, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by law, against liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by our General Partner or such other persons, if the General Partner or such persons acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests and, with respect to any criminal proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. 17 Table of Contents Our General Partner may voluntarily withdraw or sell its general partner interest. Our General Partner may withdraw as the general partner of AmeriGas Partners and the Operating Partnership without the approval of our unitholders. Our General Partner may also sell its general partner interest in AmeriGas Partners and the Operating Partnership without the approval of our unitholders. Any such withdrawal or sale could have a material adverse effect on us and could substantially change the management and resolutions of conflicts of interest, as described above. Tax Risks The IRS could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity-level taxation, which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to holders of Common Units. The availability to a common unitholder of the federal income tax benefits of an investment in the Common Units depends, in large part, on our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No ruling from the IRS as to this status has been or is expected to be requested. If we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would be required to pay tax on our income at corporate tax rates (currently a 35% federal rate), and distributions received by the common unitholders would generally be taxed a second time as corporate distributions. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as an entity, the cash available for distribution to the common unitholders would be substantially reduced. Treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the common unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the Common Units. The law could be changed so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise to be subject to entity-level taxation. If we become subject to widespread entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, it could substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders. Our Partnership Agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, certain provisions of our Partnership Agreement will be subject to change. These changes would include a decrease in the current regular quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to reflect the impact of this law on us. Any such reductions could increase our General Partners percentage of cash distributions and decrease our limited partners percentage of cash distributions. 18 Table of Contents States may subject partnerships to entity-level taxation in the future; thereby decreasing the amount of cash available to us for distributions and potentially causing a decrease in our distribution levels. Several states have enacted or are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. If additional states were to impose a tax upon us as an entity, the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced. Holders of Common Units will likely be subject to state, local and other taxes in states where holders of Common Units live or as a result of an investment in the Common Units. In addition to United States federal income taxes, unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, such as state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which the unitholder resides or in which we do business or own property. A unitholder will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property and may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all applicable United States federal, state and local tax returns. A successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions that we take may adversely affect the market for Common Units and the costs of any contest will be borne directly or indirectly by the unitholders and our General Partner. We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the classification of any of the revenue from our propane operations as qualifying income under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any other matter affecting us. Accordingly, the IRS may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions expressed herein or the positions taken by us. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings in an effort to sustain some or all of such conclusions or the positions taken by us. A court may not concur with some or all of our positions. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for the Common Units and the prices at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne directly or indirectly by the unitholders and our General Partner. Holders of Common Units may be required to pay taxes even if they do not receive any cash distributions. A unitholder will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on the unitholders allocable share of our income, even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us. We cannot guarantee that a unitholder will receive cash distributions equal to the unitholders allocable share of our taxable income or even the tax liability to the unitholder resulting from that income. Further, a unitholder may incur a tax liability, in excess of the amount of cash received, upon the sale of the unitholders Common Units. 19 Table of Contents Ownership of Common Units may have adverse tax consequences for tax-exempt organizations and certain other investors. Investment in Common Units by certain tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our taxable income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and thus will be taxable to the unitholder. Distributions to foreign persons will be reduced by withholding taxes. There are limits on the deductibility of losses that may adversely affect holders of Common Units. In the case of taxpayers subject to the passive loss rules (generally, individuals, closely-held corporations and regulated investment companies), any losses generated by us will only be available to offset our future income and cannot be used to offset income from other activities, including other passive activities or investments. Unused losses may be deducted when the unitholder disposes of the unitholders entire investment in us in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. A unitholders share of our net passive income may be offset by unused losses from us carried over from prior years, but not by losses from other passive activities, including losses from other publicly traded partnerships. Our tax shelter registration could increase the risk of a potential audit by the IRS. We are registered with the IRS as a tax shelter. The IRS has issued to us the following tax shelter registration number: 95-192000149. Issuance of the registration number does not indicate that an investment in us or the claimed tax benefits have been reviewed, examined or approved by the IRS. We cannot guarantee that we will not be audited by the IRS or that tax adjustments will not be made. The rights of a unitholder owning less than a 1% profits interest in us to participate in the income tax audit process are very limited. Further, any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us. Each unitholder would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of the unitholders personal tax return. Tax gain or loss on disposition of Common Units could be different than expected. A unitholder who sells Common Units will recognize the gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized, including the unitholders share of our nonrecourse liabilities, and the unitholders adjusted tax basis in the Common Units. Prior distributions in excess of cumulative net taxable income allocated for a common unit which decreased a unitholders tax basis in that common unit will, in effect, become taxable income if the common unit is sold at a price greater than the unitholders tax basis in that common unit, even if the price is less than the units original cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income. Furthermore, should the IRS successfully contest some conventions used by us, a unitholder could recognize more gain on the sale of Common Units than would be the case under those conventions, without the benefit of decreased income in prior years. 20 Table of Contents The reporting of partnership tax information is complicated and subject to audits. We will furnish each unitholder with a Schedule K-1 that sets forth the unitholders share of our income, gains, losses and deductions. In preparing these schedules, we will use various accounting and reporting conventions and adopt various depreciation and amortization methods. We cannot guarantee that these schedules will yield a result that conforms to statutory or regulatory requirements or to administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Further, our tax return may be audited, which could result in an audit of a unitholders individual tax return and increased liabilities for taxes because of adjustments resulting from the audit. There is a possibility of loss of tax benefits relating to nonconformity of Common Units and nonconforming depreciation conventions. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of Common Units, uniformity of the tax characteristics of the Common Units to a purchaser of Common Units of the same class must be maintained. To maintain uniformity and for other reasons, we have adopted certain depreciation and amortization conventions which we believe conform to Treasury Regulations under Section 743(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. A successful challenge to those conventions by the IRS could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a purchaser of Common Units and could have a negative impact on the value of the Common Units. Holders of Common Units may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets. If we default on any of our debt, the lenders will have the right to sue us for non-payment. This could cause an investment loss and negative tax consequences for unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution. Likewise, if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt, our unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution.
