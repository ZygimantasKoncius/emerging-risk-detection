Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and IndustryThe potential implementation by the Russian government of a law requiring Russian companies to purchase or lease the land on which they operate may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our mining subsidiaries generally have a right of perpetual use of their plots or have entered into long-term lease agreements. A lessee generally has a priority right to enter into a new land lease agreement with a lessor upon the expiration of a land lease. In order to renew a land lease agreement, the lessee must apply to the lessor (usually state or municipal authorities) for a renewal prior to the expiration of the agreement. Any lease agreement for a period equal to or longer than one year must be registered with the relevant state authorities. Environmental We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the cleanup of contaminated sites, flora and fauna protection and wildlife protection. Issues of environmental protection in Russia are regulated primarily by the Federal Law on Environmental Protection of January 10, 2002, as amended, or the Environmental Protection Law, as well as by a number of other federal and local legal acts. Pay-to-pollute The Environmental Protection Law establishes a pay-to-pollute regime administered by federal and local authorities. The Russian government has established standards relating to the permissible impact on the environment and, in particular, limits for emissions and disposal of substances, waste disposal and resource extraction. A company may obtain approval for exceeding these statutory limits from the federal or regional authorities, depending on the type and scale of environmental impact. As a condition to such approval, a plan for the reduction of the emissions or disposals must be developed by the company and cleared with the appropriate governmental authority. Fees, as set forth in a governmental decree, are assessed on a sliding scale for both the statutory or individually approved limits on emissions and effluents and for pollution in excess of these limits: the lowest fees are imposed for pollution within the statutory limits, intermediate fees are imposed for pollution within the individually approved limits, and the highest fees are imposed for pollution exceeding such limits. Payments of such fees do not relieve a company from its responsibility to take environmental protection measures and undertake restoration and clean-up activities. In 2005, we incurred such fees in the amount of $9.9 million. Ecological approval Any activities that may affect the environment are subject to state ecological approval by federal authorities in accordance with the Federal Law on Ecological Expert Examination of November 23, 1995, as amended. Conducting operations that may cause damage to the environment without state ecological approval may result in the negative consequences described in Environmental Liability below. Enforcement authorities The Federal Service for the Supervision of the Use of Natural Resources, the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision, the Federal Service for Hydrometrology and 75 Environmental Monitoring, the Federal Agency on Subsoil Use, the Federal Agency on Forestry, the Federal Agency on Water Resources (along with their regional branches) and the Federal Agency on Protection of Consumers Rights are involved in environmental control, implementation and enforcement of relevant laws and regulations. The federal government and Ministry of Natural Resources is responsible for coordinating the activities of the regulatory authorities in this area. Such regulatory authorities, along with other state authorities, individuals and public and non-governmental organizations, also have the right to initiate lawsuits for the compensation of damage caused to the environment. The statute of limitations for such lawsuits is 20 years. Environmental liability If the operations of a company violate environmental requirements or cause harm to the environment or any individual or legal entity, a court action may be brought to limit or ban these operations and require the company to remedy the effects of the violation. Any company or employees that fail to comply with environmental regulations may be subject to administrative and/or civil liability, and individuals may be held criminally liable. Courts may also impose clean-up obligations on violators in lieu of or in addition to imposing fines. Subsoil licenses generally require certain environmental commitments. Although these commitments can be substantial, the penalties for failing to comply and the clean-up requirements are generally low. Reclamation We conduct our reclamation activities in accordance with the Basic Regulation on Land Reclamation, Removal, Preservation, and Rational Use of the Fertile Soil Layer, approved by Order No. 525/67 of December 22, 1995, of the Ministry of Natural Resources. In general, our reclamation activities involve both a technical stage and a biological stage. In the first stage, we backfill the pits, grade and terrace mound slopes, level the surface of the mounds, and add clay rock on top for greater adaptability of young plants. In the biological stage, we plant conifers (pine, larch, cedar) on horizontal and gently sloping surfaces, and shrubs and bushes to reinforce inclines. Russian environmental regulations do not require mines to achieve the approximate original contour (AOC) of the property as is required, for example, in the United States. Environmental protection programs We have been developing and implementing environmental protection programs at all of our mining and steel subsidiaries. Such programs include measures to aid in our adherence to the limits imposed on air and water pollution and storage of industrial waste, introduction of environmentally friendly industrial technologies, the construction of purification and filtering facilities, the repair and reconstruction of industrial water supply systems, the installation of metering systems, reforestation and the recycling of water and industrial waste. We are a member of Ecological Movement for Specific Activities, a non-profit organization which develops and facilitates the implementation of environmental programs and individual projects for state and private institutions. Health and Safety Due to the nature of our business, much of our activity is conducted at industrial sites by large numbers of workers, and workplace safety issues are of significant importance to the operation of these sites. The principal law regulating industrial safety is the Federal Law on Industrial Safety of Dangerous Industrial Facilities of July 21, 1997, as amended, or the Safety Law. The Safety Law applies, in particular, to industrial facilities and sites where certain activities are conducted, including sites where lifting 76 machines are used, where alloys of ferrous and non-ferrous metals are produced and where certain types of mining is done. The Safety Law also contains a comprehensive list of dangerous substances and their permitted concentration, and extends to facilities and sites where these substances are used. There are also regulations that address safety rules for coal mines, the production and processing of ore, the blast-furnace industry, steel smelting, alloy production and nickel production. Additional safety rules also apply to certain industries, including metallurgical and coke chemical enterprises, and the foundry industry. Any construction, reconstruction, liquidation or other activities in relation to regulated industrial sites is subject to a state industrial safety review. Any deviation from project documentation in the process of construction, reconstruction and liquidation of industrial sites is prohibited unless reviewed by a licensed expert and approved by the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision. Companies that operate such industrial facilities and sites have a wide range of obligations under the Safety Law and the Labor Code of Russia effective February 1, 2002, as amended, or the Labor Code. In particular, they must limit access to such sites to qualified specialists, maintain industrial safety controls and carry insurance for third-party liability for injuries caused in the course of operating industrial sites. The Safety Law also requires these companies to enter into contracts with professional wrecking companies or create their own wrecking services in certain cases, conduct personnel training programs, create systems to cope with and inform the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision of accidents and maintain these systems in good working order. In certain cases, companies operating industrial sites must also prepare declarations of industrial safety which summarize the risks associated with operating a particular industrial site and measures the company has taken and will take to mitigate such risks and use the site in accordance with applicable industrial safety requirements. Such declarations must be adopted by the chief executive officer of the company, who is personally responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the data contained therein. The industrial safety declaration, as well as a state industrial safety review, are required for the issuance of a license permitting the operation of a dangerous industrial facility. The Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision has broad authority in the field of industrial safety. In case of an accident, a special commission led by a representative of the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision conducts a technical investigation of the cause. The company operating the hazardous industrial facility where the accident took place bears all costs of an investigation. The officials of the Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision have the right to access industrial sites and may inspect documents to ensure a companys compliance with safety rules. The Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision may suspend or terminate operations or impose administrative liability. Any company or individual violating industrial safety rules may incur administrative and/or civil liability, and individuals may also incur criminal liability. A company that violates safety rules in a way that negatively impacts the health of an individual may also be obligated to compensate the individual for lost earnings, as well as health-related damages. Employment and Labor Labor matters in Russia are primarily governed by the Labor Code. In addition to this core legislation, relationships between employers and employees are regulated by various federal laws, such as the Law on Collective Contracts and Agreements of March 11, 1992, as amended; the Federal Law on the Procedure of Settlement of Collective Labor Disputes of November 23, 1995, as amended; the Law on Employment in the Russian Federation of April 19, 1991, as amended; the Federal Law on the Fundamentals of Protection 77 of Labor in the Russian Federation of July 17, 1999, as amended; as well as certain administrative actions undertaken at the local level. Employment contracts As a general rule, employment contracts for an indefinite term are concluded with all employees. Russian labor legislation expressly limits the possibility of entering into term employment contracts. However, an employment contract may be entered into for a fixed term of up to five years in certain cases where labor relations may not be established for an indefinite term due to the nature of the duties or the conditions of the performance of such duties, as well as in other cases expressly identified by federal law. In some cases it is also possible to enter into an employment contract for the employee to perform specified task(s). All employment contracts are regulated by the Labor Code. An employer may terminate an employment contract only on the basis of the specific grounds enumerated in the Labor Code, including: · liquidation of the enterprise or downsizing of staff; · failure of the employee to comply with the positions requirements due to incompetence or health problems; · change of control of the employer; · repeated failure of the employee to fulfill his or her duties without cause; · employees usage of alcohol or other intoxicants at the workplace; · employees absence without cause; · any single gross violation by the employee of his or her duties; and · provision by the employee of false documents or misleading information prior to entry into the employment contract. An employee dismissed from an enterprise due to downsizing or liquidation is entitled to receive compensation including a severance payment and, depending on the circumstances, salary payments for a certain period of time. The Labor Code also provides protections for specified categories of employees. For example, except in cases of liquidation of an enterprise, an employer cannot dismiss minors, expectant mothers, mothers with a child under the age of three, single mothers with a child under the age of fourteen or other persons caring for a child under the age of 14 without a mother. Any termination by an employer that is inconsistent with the Labor Code requirements may be invalidated by a court, and the employee may be reinstated. Lawsuits resulting in the reinstatement of illegally dismissed employees and the payment of damages for wrongful dismissal are increasingly frequent, and Russian courts tend to support employees rights in most cases. Where an employee is reinstated by a court, the employer must compensate the employee for unpaid salary for the period between the wrongful termination and reinstatement, as well as for mental distress. Work time The Labor Code generally sets the regular working week at 40 hours. Any time worked beyond 40 hours per week, as well as work on public holidays and weekends, must be compensated at a higher rate. 78 For employees working in hazardous or harmful conditions, the regular working week is decreased by 4 hours in accordance with government regulations. Some of our employees working on steel and mining production entities qualify for this reduced working week. Annual paid vacation leave under the law is generally four weeks. Our employees who perform underground and open-pit mining works or other work in harmful conditions may be entitled to additional paid vacation ranging from six to 36 working days. The retirement age in the Russian Federation is 60 years for males and 55 years for females. However, employees who perform underground and open-pit mining works or other work in harmful conditions have a right to retire at an earlier age. The rules defining such earlier retirement ages are set by the Federal Law on Labor Pensions in the Russian Federation dated December 17, 2001, as amended. Salary The minimum monthly salary in Russia, as established by federal law, was 600 rubles (approximately $21) in 2004. Effective January 1, 2005, the statutory monthly minimum salary has been increased to 720 rubles (approximately $25) and was further increased to 800 rubles (approximately $29) on September 1, 2005 and will be further increased to 1,100 rubles (approximately $40) on May 1, 2006. Although the law requires that the minimum wage be at or above a minimum subsistence level, the current minimum wage is generally considered to be less than a minimum subsistence level. Strikes The Labor Code defines a strike as the temporary and voluntary refusal of workers to fulfill their work duties with the intention of settling a collective labor dispute. Russian legislation contains several requirements for legal strikes. Participation in a legal strike may not be considered by an employer as grounds for terminating an employment contract, although employers are generally not required to pay wages to striking employees for the duration of the strike. Participation in an illegal strike may be adequate grounds for termination. Trade Unions Although recent Russian labor regulations have curtailed the authority of trade unions, they still retain significant influence over employees and, as such, may affect the operations of large industrial companies in Russia. In this regard, our management routinely interacts with trade unions in order to ensure the appropriate treatment of our employees and the stability of our business. The activities of trade unions are generally governed by the Federal Law on Trade Unions, Their Rights and Guaranties of Their Activity of January 12, 1996, as amended, or the Trade Union Law. Other applicable legal acts include the Labor Code of Russia, the Law on Collective Contracts and Agreements of March 11, 1992, as amended, and the Federal Law on the Procedure for Settlement of Collective Labor Disputes of November 23, 1995, as amended, which provide for more detailed regulations relating to activities of trade unions. The Trade Union Law defines a trade union as a voluntary union of individuals with common professional and other interests that is incorporated for the purposes of representing and protecting the rights and interests of its members. National trade union associations, which coordinate activities of trade unions throughout Russia, are also permitted. As part of their activities, trade unions may: · negotiate collective contracts and agreements such as those between the trade unions and employers, federal, regional and local governmental authorities and other entities; 79 · monitor compliance with labor laws, collective contracts and other agreements; · access work sites and offices, and request information relating to labor issues from the management of companies and state and municipal authorities; · represent their members and other employees in individual and collective labor disputes with management; · participate in strikes; and · monitor redundancy of employees and seek action by municipal authorities to delay or suspend mass layoffs. Russian laws require that companies cooperate with trade unions and do not interfere with their activities. Trade unions and their officers enjoy certain guarantees as well, such as: · legal restrictions as to rendering redundant employees elected or appointed to the management of trade unions; · protection from disciplinary punishment or dismissal on the initiative of the employer without prior consent of the management of the trade union and, in certain circumstances, the consent of the relevant trade union association; · retention of job positions for those employees who stop working due to their election to the management of trade unions; · protection from dismissal for employees who previously served in the management of a trade union for two years after the termination of the office term; and · provision of the necessary equipment, premises and transportation vehicles by the employer for use by the trade union free of charge, if provided for by a collective bargaining contract or other agreement. If a trade union discovers any violation of work condition requirements, notification is sent to the employer with a request to cure the violation and to suspend work if there is an immediate threat to the lives or health of employees. The trade union may also apply to state authorities and labor inspectors and prosecutors to ensure that an employer does not violate Russian labor laws. Trade unions may also initiate collective labor disputes, which may lead to strikes. To initiate a collective labor dispute, trade unions present their demands to the employer. The employer is then obliged to consider the demands and notify the trade union of its decision. If the dispute remains unresolved, a reconciliation commission attempts to end the dispute. If this proves unsuccessful, collective labor disputes are generally referred to mediation or labor arbitration. The Trade Union Law provides that those who violate the rights and guaranties provided to trade unions and their officers may be subject to disciplinary, administrative and criminal liability. Although neither the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Misdemeanors, nor the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, currently has provisions specifically relating to these violations, general provisions and sanctions may be applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information in this document. This Item 5 contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described in Item 3 and under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 80 The Reorganization Mechel OAO was incorporated on March 19, 2003, under the laws of the Russian Federation in connection with a reorganization to serve as a holding company for various mining and steel companies owned by Messrs. Igor Zyuzin and Vladimir Iorich or parties affiliated with them. These individuals acquired these companies at various times from 1995 to the present and have acted in concert since that time pursuant to an Ownership, Control and Voting Agreement which requires them to vote the same way. The reorganization involved the contribution of these companies by these individuals to Mechel in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of Mechel. Many of the contributed companies had shareholders other than Messrs. Zyuzin and Iorich, and these shareholders were not involved in the reorganization and continue to retain minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries. The acquisition of these companies by Mechel represents a reorganization under common control, and has been accounted for in a manner akin to a pooling. Mechels consolidated financial statements, therefore, have been prepared on the basis that Mechel existed for all periods presented since its inception and owned these companies to the same extent as owned by Messrs. Zyuzin and Iorich in those periods. Business Structure Segments We have organized our businesses into two segments: · the mining segment, comprising production and sale of coal (coking and steam), iron ore and nickel, which supplies raw materials to our steel business and also sells substantial amounts of raw materials to third parties; and · the steel segment, comprising production and sale of semi-finished steel products; carbon and specialty long products; carbon and stainless flat products; value-added downstream metal products including hardware, forgings and stampings; and coke and coking products. 81 The table below sets forth by segment our primary mining and steel subsidiaries, presented in chronological order by date of acquisition. Name Location Business Date Control Acquired Voting Interest(1) % Mining Segment(2) Southern Kuzbass Coal Company(3) Russia Coking coal concentrate, steam coal, steam coal concentrate January 1999 93.7 Krasnogorsk Open Pit Mine Russia Steam coal, steam coal concentrate January 1999 88.9 Tomusinsk Open Pit Mine Russia Coking coal, steam coal January 1999 74.4 Olzherassk Open Pit Mine Russia Coking coal, steam coal December 1999 81.9 Southern Urals Nickel Plant Russia Ferronickel December 2001 79.9 Lenin Mine Russia Coking coal December 2001 79.2 Korshunov Mining Plant Russia Iron ore concentrate October 2003 85.5 Port Posiet Russia Shipping February 2004 93.4 Port Kambarka Russia River shipping April 2005 90.4 Steel Segment Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant Russia Semi-finished steel products, carbon and specialty long and flat steel products, forgings, coke and coking products December 2001 93.7 Vyartsilya Metal Products Plant Russia Hardware May 2002 93.3 Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant Russia Long steel products, hardware, limestone(4) June 2002 90.3 Mechel Targoviste Romania Carbon and specialty long steel products, forgings, hardware August 2002 83.7 Urals Stampings Plant Russia Stampings April 2003 93.8 Mechel Campia Turzii Romania Long steel products, hardware June 2003 85.2 Mechel Nemunas Lithuania Hardware October 2003 100.0 Izhstal Russia Specialty and carbon steel long products, hardware, stampings and forgings May 2004 87.7 Mechel Recycling Russia Metal scrap processing March 2006 100.0 (1) The percentages provided in this table are as of March 31, 2006. As of that date, some of our Russian subsidiaries had preferred shares outstanding that have voting rights commensurate with common shares if dividends on those shares have not been paid. We have calculated voting interests by including these preferred shares for subsidiaries where dividends have not been paid. (2) The mining segment includes our shipping operations, which support both our mining and steel segments. 82 (3) We merged the following legal entities into Southern Kuzbass Coal Company in November-December 2005: Sibirginsk Open Pit Mine Kuzbass Central Processing Plant Siberian Central Processing Plant We intend to merge our other coal mining subsidiaries into Southern Kuzbass Coal Company in the future. (4) Our Pugachev limestone quarry is owned by Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant and is within the steel segment. Intersegment sales We are an integrated mining and steel group. Our mining segment supplies 100% of our steel segments coking coal requirements, 97% of our iron requirements, and 49% of our nickel requirements. Our steel segment also supplies wires, ropes and other hardware to our mining segment for use in its day-to-day operations, as well as coke for use in the production of nickel. The prices at which we record these transfers are based on market prices, and these transactions are eliminated as intercompany transactions for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, mining segment sales to the steel segment amounted to $336.6 million, $323.0 million and $185.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, steel segment sales to the mining segment amounted to $56.6 million, $74.7 million and $42.3 million, respectively. Summary of Acquisitions We have sought to develop an integrated mining and steel business through the purchase of under-performing assets which we believe offer significant upside potential, particularly as we implement improvements in working practices and operational methods. Pending the implementation of these practices and our other integration strategies, our margins are initially adversely affected after each acquisition. Following is a summary of the terms of acquisition of our primary mining and steel subsidiaries and significant investments since 2001. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, so the results of operations of each acquired business are included in our consolidated income statements since their respective dates of acquisition of control. In certain cases where we acquired our interest in these businesses over a period of time and thus control was not acquired until subsequent acquisitions of shares, until such controlling stake was acquired, these businesses were accounted for using the equity method of accounting or at cost, as appropriate. Our results of operations for the periods presented herein are thus not comparable from period to period due to these acquisitions and their accounting treatment. · Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant is an integrated blast furnace and BOF/EAF steel mill that produces coke, semi-finished and rolled carbon and specialty steel products and forgings.

Mechel Recycling is a Chelyabinsk-based metal scrap processing company. We acquired a 100% stake in Mechel Recycling in March 2006 for $6.0 million. 85 The acquisition of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant in December 2001, an integrated steel mill with its own coking batteries, was our most significant steel acquisition and it is the center of our steel segment operations. Prior to its acquisition, we were primarily a coal mining and trading company. In the year of its acquisition, we had been running Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant on a contract basis, our trading operations had been selling Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plants products and we had supplied it with most of its coking coal requirements, so we were already familiar with its operations and customers. The addition of Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant in June 2002, a market leader in hardware in Russia and whose products our trading operations had been selling prior to its acquisition, significantly expanded our presence in this product category, and this presence was also bolstered by our acquisition of Vyartsilya Metal Products Plant in May 2002. Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant and Vyartsilya Metal Products Plant are supplied with semi-finished steel by Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Our downstream product mix was also further widened by the purchase of Urals Stampings Plant in April 2003, which uses Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plants specialty steel to make value-added stampings. We further solidified our presence in the Russian specialty steel market by the acquisition of Izhstal in May 2004. Additionally, our Romanian acquisitions, Mechel Targoviste in August 2002, Mechel Campia Turzii in June 2003 and Mechel Nemunas in October 2003, marked our expansion outside Russia. Mechel Targoviste produces specialty long products and Mechel Campia Turzii and Mechel Nemunas produce hardware. Mechel Nemunas is supplied with semi-finished steel from our Russian operations. Discontinued Operations In late 2003 and the first half of 2004, we disposed of our controlling stakes in (1) Belov Insurance Company ZAO, a small insurance company in which we had acquired a controlling stake in 2001, and (2) Uglemetbank ZAO, a small bank in which we had acquired a controlling stake in 1999, to their management and other unrelated investors. These companies provided our coal companies and their employees with routine banking, finance and insurance services. The results for these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 in our consolidated financial statements. In August 2004, we terminated production at Mechel Zeljezara, a Croatian steel mill that produced pipes. Mechel Zeljezaras assets were acquired out of bankruptcy proceedings in March 2003. We decided to terminate production at Mechel Zeljezara due to significant increases in input costs and a persistent weakness in pipe prices. In September 2004, we concluded a termination agreement providing for the return to the seller of the Mechel Zeljezara assets, the redemption of the bank guarantee that we granted to the government of Croatia in the amount of $4.3 million and the donation of spare parts at Mechel Zeljezara in the amount of $1.8 million, in return for a waiver of any and all claims against us. We started accounting for Mechel Zeljezara as discontinued operations in September 2004. Mechel Zeljezara is currently in liquidation, which is expected to be concluded in 2006. The results of operations of Mechel Zeljezara were included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition in March 2003. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 these results were reflected in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 86 Results of Operations The following table sets forth our income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The following table sets out revenues by segment. Year ended December 31, Revenues by segment 2005 2004 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) Mining segment To third parties 1,094,782 878,417 To steel segment 336,593 322,992 Total 1,431,375 1,201,409 Steel segment To third parties 2,710,213 2,757,538 To mining segment 56,633 74,651 Total 2,766,846 2,832,189 Eliminations 393,226 397,643 Consolidated revenues 3,804,995 3,635,955 % from mining segment 28.8 % 24.2 % % from steel segment 71.2 % 75.8 % Mining segment Our total mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $230.0 million, or 19.1%, to $1,431.4 million from $1,201.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Coking coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $60.8 million, or 15.1%, primarily due to price increases, partially offset by volume decreases. Coking coal concentrate supplied to the steel segment decreased by $7.7 million, or 3.2%, primarily as a result of decrease in the volume supplied to our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Steam coal and steam coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $61.9 million, or 29.3%, primarily due to price increases. Sales of iron ore to third parties increased by $53.2 million, or 46.8%, to $167.1 million and supplies to the steel segment increased by $36.9 million, or 70.0%, to $89.7 million, primarily due to price increases. Nickel sales to third parties increased by $42.5 million, or 39.4%, primarily due to price increases. Nickel supplies to the steel segment decreased by $16.6 million, or 42.9%, due to a decrease in production of products that require nickel at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 55.7% of mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 67.0% in the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in the proportion of our export sales was due to the higher domestic volumes generated by increased demand from domestic steelmakers and lower export volumes. Although export prices were higher compared with domestic prices, the world market for materials was down (the weighted average export price of our mining products increased by $13.5 per tonne whereas the weighted average domestic price for our mining products increased by $19.8 per tonne). 88 Steel segment Our steel segment revenues decreased by $65.5 million, or 2.3%, to $2,766.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,832.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in steel segment revenues is primarily explained by the following decreases totaling $340.0 million: · Wire rod sales decreased by $120.3 million or 39.5% due to sales volume decreases that occurred as a result of excess supply of this product on both Russian and international markets; · Stainless flat product sales decreased by $48.4 million, or 51.3%, mostly due to volume decreases that occurred as a result of decreases of production volumes of these products at our Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant caused by excess of imported stainless products on the Russian market; · Sales of other products and services decreased by $150.7 million, or 78.1%, mainly due to reductions in our sales volumes of products of third parties in line with our strategy to sell more of our own products rather than resell products of third parties; and · Pig iron sales decreased by $20.6 million, or 55.2%, primarily as a result of higher internal consumption. Counteracting these decreases were the following increases for the year ended December 31, 2005: · Rebar sales increased by $11.3 million, or 1.8%, due to volume increases partially offset by price decreases; · Sales of coke and coking products to third parties increased by $9.5 million, or 16.6%, due to sales volume increases, while supplies to the mining segment, which uses coke in the production of nickel, decreased by $18.9 million, or 27.9%, due to lower production volumes. · Hardware sales were higher by $47.6 million, or 14.6%, including an increase in wire sales of $40.9 million, or 19.2%, mainly due to sales volume increases, and an increase in rope sales of $3.3 million, or 6.3%, mainly due to price increases; · Sales of carbon and low-alloy flat products increased by $34.5 million, or 24.8%, mainly due to volume increases but also price increases; · Sales of stainless and alloyed long products increased by $47.3 million, or 41.0%, due to price increases partially offset by volume decreases; · Carbon and low-alloyed long product sales grew by $170.0 million, or 96.1%, mostly as a result of price increases; and · Forgings and forged alloy sales increased by $21.9 million, or 30.6%, due to volume increases. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 44.7% of steel segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 51.0% in the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in the proportion of our export sales was largely due to a decrease in export prices in 2005 compared to 2004. 89 Cost of goods sold and gross margin Consolidated cost of goods sold was 64.8% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 61.2% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2004, resulting in a decrease in the consolidated gross margin percentage in the year ended December 31, 2005, to 35.1% from 38.8% in the year ended December 31, 2004. Cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs relating to raw materials (including products purchased for resale), direct payroll, depreciation and energy. The table below sets forth cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Cost of goods sold 715,738 50.0 557,251 46.4 Gross margin 715,637 50.0 644,158 53.6 Steel segment Cost of goods sold 2,146,621 77.6 2,065,480 72.9 Gross margin 620,225 22.4 766,709 27.1 Mining segment Mining segment cost of goods sold increased by $158.5 million, or 28.4%, to $715.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $557.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Mining segment gross margin percentage decreased from 53.6% in the year ended December 31, 2004, to 50.0% in the year ended December 31, 2005. The slight decrease in the mining segments gross margin percentage is explained by the fact that in 2005 our costs grew faster than sales prices for coal, nickel and iron ore. Steel segment Steel segment cost of goods sold increased by $81.1 million, or 3.9%, to $2,146.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2,065.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Steel segment cost of goods sold was 77.6% of the segments revenues in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 72.9% in the year ended December 31, 2004, resulting in a decline in gross margin from 27.1% to 22.4%. This decline is attributed to costs increasing faster than prices. 90 Selling, distribution and operating expenses Selling, distribution and operating expenses increased by $160.1 million, or 24.3%, to $820.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $660.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, selling, distribution and operating expenses increased to 21.6% in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2004. Our selling, distribution and operating expenses consist primarily of selling and distribution expenses, taxes other than income tax, loss on write off of property, plant and equipment, provision for doubtful accounts and general, administrative and other operating expenses. The table below sets forth these costs by segment for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Selling, distribution and operating expenses by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses 190,440 13.3 160,578 13.4 Taxes other than income tax 29,506 2.1 27,140 2.3 Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment     Accretion expense 1,625 0.1 1,137 0.1 Provision for doubtful accounts 1,230 0.1 (3,323 ) (0.3 ) General, administrative and other operating expenses 91,581 6.4 74,568 6.2 Total 314,383 22.0 260,100 21.7 Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses 259,797 9.4 206,933 7.3 Taxes other than income tax 61,177 2.2 42,145 1.5 Loss on write off of property, plant and equipment 12,667 0.5   Accretion expense 1,622 0.1 944 0.0 Provision for doubtful accounts 2,338 0.1 (4,536 ) (0.2 ) General, administrative and other operating expenses 168,147 6.1 154,471 5.5 Total 505,749 18.3 399,957 14.1 Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and increased by $29.8 million in line with sales volume increases in 2005. As a percentage of mining segment revenues they remained constant in 2005 in comparison with 2004. Taxes other than income tax increased by $2.4 million, or 8.7%, from $27.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, to $29.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase is mainly explained by the increase in penalties and fines paid to environmental agencies and other non-budgeted items at the Korshunov Mining Plant. Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $4.6 million, from $(3.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2004, to $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to changes in our estimates of bad debts at the respective period ends. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $17.0 million, or 22.8%, to $91.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $74.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, representing an increase as a percentage of segment revenues from 6.2% to 6.4%. Salaries and related social taxes increased by $13.2 million mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies and also due to increases in management bonuses, social expenses (including pension) increased by $4.7 million due to the expansion in social activities of our production companies and increases in charity expenses and donations, and legal and consulting fees and insurance services increased by $4.0 million due 91 to increases in consulting fees. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $2.5 million, and depreciation increased by $0.7 million due to the overall expansion of segment activities in 2005. Finally, additional expenses, including penalties for delays in the delivery of finished goods, security expenses, expenses related to acquiring equipment and other expenses, decreased by $8.0 million due to tighter control over administrative expenses resulting in a decrease in fines and penalties and security expenses. Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and increased as a percentage of steel segment revenues from 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2004, to 9.4% in the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of increases in transportation tariffs. Taxes other than income tax includes property and land taxes, and other taxes. These amounted to $61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $19.0 million, or 45.1%, from $42.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. As a percentage of segment revenues, these taxes increased from 1.5% to 2.2%. Property and land taxes amounted to $29.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $5.4 million, or 22.6%, from $23.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, due to an increase in the property tax base (as a result of putting into operation new fixed assets). In 2005, an additional tax charge of $10.0 million was recognized in certain of our subsidiaries as a result of tax audits of previous periods. The amounts claimed by tax authorities were mainly comprised of export VAT payable and related fines and penalties. In December 2005, we decided to restructure the production process for each of Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii in order to increase their efficiency and profitability. As a result of this restructuring, certain production workshops of Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii were discontinued in early 2006, with some property, plant and equipment abandoned rather than disposed of by sale. As of December 31, 2005, the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment at these workshops was $12.7 million and was written off in the full amount (see also note 3(l) to our consolidated financial statements). Provision for doubtful accounts increased by $6.8 million from $(4.5) million in the year ended December 31, 2004, to $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to changes in our estimate of bad debts as of the respective period ends. General, administrative and other expenses, which consisted of payroll and related social taxes, depreciation, rent and maintenance, legal and consulting expenses, office expenses and other expenses, increased by $13.7 million, or 8.9%, to $168.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $154.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, and increased as a percentage of segment revenues from 5.5% in the year ended December 31, 2004, to 6.1% in the year ended December 31, 2005. Payroll and related social taxes increased by $8.4 million mainly due to indexation of salary rates to inflation at our production companies and also due to increases in management bonuses. Social expenses (including pension) increased by $5.8 million due to the expansion in social activities of our production companies and increases in charity expenses and donations. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses decreased by $1.3 million primarily due to tighter control over administrative expenses at our production companies. Professional expenses, which include auditing, accounting, legal and engineering fees, and insurance services increased by $4.9 million, primarily due to an increase in consulting fees in 2005. Finally, additional expenses, including directors and officers insurance, penalties for delays in deliveries of finished goods, security expenses and other expenses decreased by $5.2 million due to tighter control over administrative expenses resulting in a decrease in fines and penalties and security expenses. 92 Operating income Operating income decreased by $235.1 million, or 31.3%, to $515.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $750.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased from 20.7% in the year ended December 31, 2004, to 13.6% in the year ended December 31, 2005, due to deterioration in the gross margin percentage, which occurred as a result of increased selling, distribution and operating expenses (including losses resulting from write-offs of property, plant and equipment related to Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii) compared to growth in consolidated revenues. The table below sets out operating income by segment, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Operating income by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment 401,252 28.0 384,053 32.0 Steel segment 114,475 4.1 366,754 12.9 Mining segment Mining segment operating income in the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by $17.2 million, or 4.5%, to $401.3 million from $384.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating margin percentage decreased from 32.0% to 28.0% due to a decrease in segment gross profit margin and increases in general, administrative and other expenses. Steel segment Steel segment operating income in the year ended December 31, 2005, decreased by $252.2 million, or 65.7%, to $114.5 million from $366.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating margin percentage decreased from 12.9% to 4.1% due to a decrease in gross margin percentage, as well as the increase in selling, distribution and operating expenses (including losses resulting from write-offs of property, plant and equipment related to Mechel Targoviste and Mechel Campia Turzii). Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net consists of income (loss) of equity investees, interest income, interest expense, other income and foreign exchange gain. The table below sets forth these costs for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, including as a percentage of sales Year ended December 31, 2005 Year ended December 31, 2004 Other income and expense, net Amount % of revenues Amount % of revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Income (loss) from equity investees 12,426 0.3 4,621 0.1 Interest income 10,049 0.3 2,375 0.1 Interest expense (40,829 ) (1.1 ) (51,409 ) (1.4 ) Other income, net 65,920 1.7 836,817 23.0 Foreign exchange gain (loss) (37,435 ) (1.0 ) 1,884 0.1 Total 10,131 0.3 794,288 21.9 Most of the income from equity investees in the year ended December 31, 2004, related to Mechel Energy AG, and also included income from investees of Southern Kuzbass Coal Company. The income from equity investees in the year ended December 31, 2005, in the amount of $9.3 million related to Yakutugol, in which we acquired a 25% + 1 share in 2005. 93 Interest income increased by $7.7 million to $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due to higher average cash balances held in short-term deposits with financial institutions during 2005, partly resulting from the cash received in the sale of our stake in MMK at the end of 2004. Interest expense decreased by $10.6 million, or 20.6%, to $40.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $51.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was due to lower average loan balances of our companies in 2005 due to repayment of short-term loans and also due to an increase in interest expense capitalized in the cost of property, plant and equipment of $7.6 million. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded other income of $65.9 million, primarily consisting of gains related to the forgiveness of restructured tax liabilities in our Russian subsidiaries and accounts payable on expired contracts of $61.7 million. In 2004, other income had primarily consisted of a gain from the sale of our stake in MMK of $800.0 million. In the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign exchange loss was $37.3 million, as compared to a gain of $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. This foreign exchange loss is primarily attributed to losses from devaluation of our cash balances in euro accounts. Income tax expense Income tax expense decreased by $39.1 million to $136.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, from $175.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, while our effective tax rate increased to 26.0% from 11.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2005 is due primarily to the absence in our taxable income of the gain on the sale of our stake in MMK of $800.0 million that took place in 2004. Minority interest Minority interest in income of subsidiaries amounted to $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to a minority interest in income of subsidiaries of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. The minority interest in the income of our subsidiaries in 2005 consisted primarily of the share of minority shareholders in the net income of Korshunov Mining Plant of $2.7 million and of our coal companies of $8.2 million, which was partially offset by the share of minority shareholders in the net losses of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant of $9.3 million. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2005, was $382.3 million, compared to $1,357.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, as a result of the factors explained above. Loss from discontinued operations Loss from discontinued operations amounted to $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to loss from discontinued operations of $15.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. In both periods it related to Mechel Zeljezara. Mechel Zeljezara performed its activities until August 2004 when we decided to terminate production; in 2005 no significant activities were performed by this company. Net income For the reasons set forth above, our net income decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005, by $961.5 million, or 71.6%, from $1,342.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, to $381.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2005. 94 Year ended December 31, 2004, compared to year ended December 31, 2003 Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $1,607.9 million, or 79.3%, to $3,636.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $2,028.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. The following table sets out revenues by segment. Year ended December 31, Revenues by segment 2004 2003 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) Mining segment To third parties 878,417 413,943 To steel segment 322,992 185,813 Total 1,201,409 599,756 Steel segment To third parties 2,757,538 1,614,108 To mining segment 74,651 42,250 Total 2,832,189 1,656,358 Eliminations 397,643 228,063 Consolidated revenues 3,635,955 2,028,051 % from mining segment 24.2 % 20.4 % % from steel segment 75.8 % 79.6 % Mining segment Our total mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by $601.7 million, or 100.3%, to $1,201.4 million from $599.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Coking coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $222.0 million, or 123.2%, primarily due to price increases, as well as to a 30.1% increase in sales volume. Coking coal concentrate supplied to the steel segment increased by $96.4 million, or 70.1%, primarily as a result of an increase in the price of coking coal concentrate. Steam coal and steam coal concentrate sales to third parties increased by $91.0 million, or 76.4%, primarily due to price increases. Nickel sales to third parties increased by $28.0 million, or 34.9%, primarily due to price increases. We recorded iron ore sales in the mining segment beginning in October 2003 with our consolidation of Korshunov Mining Plant. For the year ended December 31, 2004, sales to third parties amounted to $113.8 million and supplies to the steel segment amounted to $52.8 million, for a total of $166.7 million, and the net increase in sales of iron ore was $138.3 million. Other sales increased by $29.8 million, consisting primarily of transportation, blasting and municipal services. These increases in mining products sales were partly offset by a decrease of $5.7 million in nickel supplied to the steel segment. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 67.1% of mining segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 45.1% in the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in the proportion of our export sales was due to higher export prices in relation to domestic prices (the weighted average export price of our mining products increased by $19.4 per tonne, whereas the weighted average 95 domestic price of our mining products increased by $14.0 per tonne), as well as increased export volume levels in response to the higher export prices. Steel segment Our steel segment revenues increased by $1,175.8 million, or 71.0%, to $2,832.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,656.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in steel segment revenues is primarily explained by the following increases: · Rebar sales increased by $220.7 million, or 61.5%, due to price increases, and wire rod sales increased by $123.2 million, or 70.5%, due to price increases. · Sales of semi-finished products increased by $336.4 million, or 340.0%, of which 61.3% was due to volume increases and 38.7% was due to price increases. · Hardware sales were higher by $108.7 million, or 70.6%, including an increase in wire sales of $74.3 million, or 71.7%, an increase in rope sales of $22.6 million, or 83.7%, and an increase in nails and other hardware sales of $11.8 million, or 50.4%, of which 73.2% was due to volume increases and 26.8% was due to price increases. · Sales of carbon and low-alloy flat products increased by $49.6 million, or 55.4%, due to price increases. · Sales of stainless and alloyed long products increased by $19.9 million, or 30.2%, due to price increases exceeding volume decreases. · Carbon and low-alloyed long product sales grew by $73.3 million, or 48.6%, mostly as a result of price increases. · Forgings and forged alloy sales increased by $29.4 million, or 32.1%, due to price increases. · Sales of coke and coking products to third parties increased by $14.0 million, or 31.3%, and sales to the mining segment, which uses coke in the production of nickel, grew by $32.4 million, or 88.3%, in both cases primarily as a result of substantial increases in the price of coke which was partly offset by a decrease in sales. · Pig iron sales increased by $21.9 million, or 142.2%, primarily as a result of price increases. · Stainless flat product sales increased by $10.9 million, or 13.0%, mostly due to price increases exceeding volume decreases. · Sales of other products and services, mainly products of third parties, increased by $128.0 million. In addition to the above, the following increases were related to acquisitions: · Revenues at Urals Stampings Plant for the first three months of 2004, Mechel Campia Turzii for the first five months of 2004 and Mechel Nemunas for the first nine months of 2004, which are not included in the comparative analysis by product above, amounted to $91.1 million. · Revenues at Izhstal for the year ended December 31, 2004, amounted to $149.5 million. These increases in steel products sales were offset by sales decreases as follows: · Sales of MMK products in the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $26.4 million, which is a decrease of $196.7 million compared to $223.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was the result of our termination in January 2004 of purchasing MMK steel products. 96 · Trading sales of iron ore from Korshunov Mining Plant in the year ended December 31, 2003, amounted to $36.5 million and were included in steel segment sales until its consolidation in October 2003; in 2004 its revenues are being reflected in the mining segment. Excluding intersegment sales, export sales were 51.0% of steel segment sales in the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 44.4% in the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in the proportion of our export sales was largely due to relatively higher growth in our export sales volumes compared to domestic sales volumes in 2004. Cost of goods sold and gross margin Consolidated cost of goods sold was 61.2% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 70.2% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2003, resulting in an increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage in the year ended December 31, 2004, to 38.8% from 29.8% in the year ended December 31, 2003. Cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs relating to raw materials (including products purchased for resale), direct payroll, depreciation and energy. The table below sets forth cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Cost of goods sold and gross margin by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Cost of goods sold 557,251 46.4 420,736 70.2 Gross margin 644,158 53.6 179,020 29.9 Steel segment Cost of goods sold 2,065,480 72.9 1,230,314 74.3 Gross margin 766,709 27.1 426,044 25.7 Mining segment Mining segment cost of goods sold increased by $136.5 million, or 32.4%, to $557.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $420.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Mining segment gross margin percentage increased from 29.9% in the year ended December 31, 2003, to 53.6% in the year ended December 31, 2004. The improvement in the mining segments gross margin was attributable to a substantial increase in the average sales price of coal and nickel, which increased by 77.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Steel segment Steel segment cost of goods sold increased by $835.2 million, or 67.9%, to $2,065.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $1,230.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Steel segment cost of goods sold was 72.9% of segment revenues, as compared to 74.3% in the year ended December 31, 2003. Selling, distribution and operating expenses Selling, distribution and operating expenses increased by $252.7 million, or 62.0%, to $660.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $407.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, selling, distribution and operating expenses decreased to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 20.1% in the year ended December 31, 2003. Our selling, distribution and operating expenses consist primarily of selling and distribution expenses, taxes 97 other than income tax, provision for doubtful accounts and general, administrative and other operating expenses. The table below sets forth these costs by segment for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Selling, distribution and operating expenses by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses 160,578 13.4 61,546 10.3 Taxes other than income tax 27,140 2.3 12,105 2.0 Accretion expense 1,137 0.1 1,677 0.3 Provision for doubtful accounts (3,323 ) (0.3 ) 76 0.0 General, administrative and other operating expenses 74,568 6.2 40,166 6.7 Total 260,100 21.7 115,570 19.3 Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses 206,933 7.3 152,432 9.2 Taxes other than income tax 42,145 1.5 32,611 2.0 Accretion expense 944 0.0 756 0.0 Provision for doubtful accounts (4,536 ) (0.2 ) 8,980 0.5 General, administrative and other operating expenses 154,471 5.5 97,035 5.9 Total 399,957 14.1 291,814 17.6 Mining segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and increased as a percentage of mining segment revenues from 10.3% in the year ended December 31, 2003, to 13.4% in the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of an increase in our export sales with higher cost of transportation than domestic sales, partly offset by the increased use of our own railway freight and forwarding company for our transportation needs, which we established in the end of 2002. Taxes other than income tax increased by $15.0 million, or 124.2%, from $12.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, to $27.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Property and land taxes increased by $11.7 million due to an increase in the land tax base and property tax base (as a result of putting into operation new fixed assets). Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $3.4 million, from $0.08 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, to $(3.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2004, due to recoveries and an improvement in the aging of the accounts receivable as of the respective period ends. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $34.4 million, or 85.7%, to $74.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $40.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, representing a decrease as a percentage of segment revenues from 6.7% to 6.2%. Salaries and related social taxes increased by $10.3 million, social expenses (including pension) increased by $11.1 million, legal and consulting fees, and insurance services increased by $2.5 million. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $3.9 million, and depreciation increased by $1.1 million. The increase in salaries and social expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Korshunov Mining Plant in October 2003 and salary increases at our coal companies. Other expenses, including 98 penalties for delays in deliveries of finished goods, security expenses and other expenses, increased by $5.4 million. Steel segment Selling and distribution expenses consisted almost entirely of transportation expenses related to our selling activities, and decreased as a percentage of steel segment revenues from 9.2% in the year ended December 31, 2003, to 7.3% in the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of the increasing use of our own railway freight and forwarding company for our transportation needs, which we established at the end of 2002. Taxes other than income tax includes property and land taxes, and other taxes. These amounted to $42.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $9.5 million, or 29.2%, from $32.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. As a percentage of segment revenues, these taxes declined from 2.0% to 1.5%. Property and land taxes amounted to $23.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $5.4 million, or 29.5%, from $18.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, due to an increase in the property tax base (as a result of putting into operation new fixed assets and the acquisition of Izhstal). Provision for doubtful accounts decreased by $13.5 million from $9.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, to $(4.5) million in the year ended December 31, 2004, due to recoveries and an improvement in the aging of the accounts receivable as of the respective period ends. General, administrative and other expenses, which consisted of payroll and related social taxes, depreciation, rent and maintenance, legal and consulting expenses, office expenses and other expenses, increased by $57.4 million, or 59.2%, to $154.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $97.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, and decreased as a percentage of segment revenues from 5.9% in the year ended December 31, 2003, to 5.5% in the year ended December 31, 2004. Payroll and related social taxes increased by $15.0 million, half of which was due to the acquisition of Izhstal. Social expenses (including pension) increased by $12.2 million. Rent and maintenance, business travel expenses, bank charges and office expenses increased by $10.7 million. Professional expenses, which include audit, accounting, legal and engineering fees, and insurance services increased by $2.9 million.

Operating income Operating income increased by $552.8 million, or 279.7%, to $750.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $197.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased from 9.7% in the year ended December 31, 2003, to 20.6% in the year ended December 31, 2004, due to the substantial improvement in the gross margin percentage and the relatively stable selling, distribution and operating expenses compared to growth in consolidated revenues. The table below sets out operating income by segment, including as a percentage of segment revenues. Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Operating income by segment Amount % of segment revenues Amount % of segment revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Mining segment 384,053 32.0 63,450 10.6 Steel segment 366,754 12.9 134,230 8.1 99 Mining segment Mining segment operating income in the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by $320.6 million, or 505.3%, to $384.1 million from $63.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating margin percentage increased from 10.6% to 32.0% due to significant growth in segment gross margin, partly offset by growth in selling, distribution and operating expenses. Steel segment Steel segment operating income in the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by $232.5 million, or 173.2%, to $366.8 million from $134.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating margin percentage increased from 8.1% to 12.9% due to the increase in the gross margin percentage and the decrease in selling, distribution and operating expenses compared to the growth in segment revenues. Other income and expense, net Other income and expense, net consists of income (loss) of equity investees, interest income, interest expense, other income and foreign exchange gain. The table below sets forth these costs for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, including as a percentage of sales: Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Other income and expense, net Amount % of revenues Amount % of revenues (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Income (loss) from equity investees 4,621 0.1 1,221 0.1 Interest income 2,375 0.1 2,274 0.1 Interest expense (51,409 ) (1.4 ) (48,516 ) (2.4 ) Other income, net 836,817 23.0 26,333 1.3 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 1,884 0.1 (2,867 ) (0.1 ) Total 794,288 21.9 (21,555 ) (1.1 ) The income from equity investees in the year ended December 31, 2003, was related to investees of Southern Kuzbass Coal Company. Most of the income from equity investees in the year ended December 31, 2004, related to Mechel Energy AG, and also included income from investees of Southern Kuzbass Coal Company. Interest income increased by $0.1 million to $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Our businesses earned interest income on the cash balances held with financial institutions. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million, or 6.0%, to $51.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase related to an increase in short-term debt and long-term debt partly offset by a reduction in interest rates, as well as to interest expense on debt of acquired businesses of $0.9 million. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded other income of $836.8 million, primarily consisting of the following: net profit from the sale of our shareholding in MMK for $800.0 million, gains of $18.3 million from fines and penalties forgiven due to the timely payment of restructured prior period taxes and social charges (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements), a loss of $2.0 million on the sale of promissory notes, a gain of $2.4 million from dividends received, and net gain of $18.1 million on other sales and other expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2004, foreign exchange gain was $1.9 million, as compared to a loss of $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. 100 Income tax expense Income tax expense increased by $128.0 million to $175.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, from $47.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, and our effective tax rate decreased to 11.4% from 27.1%. The decrease in the effective tax rates is due primarily to an increase of our income being generated in jurisdictions having lower tax rates. Minority interest Minority interest in income of subsidiaries amounted to $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to a minority interest in losses of subsidiaries of $19.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Minority interest in income of subsidiaries in the current period consisted primarily of the share of minority shareholders in the net income of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant and our coal subsidiaries in the amount of $16.5 million, partly offset by the share of minority shareholders in the net losses of Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant, Mechel Targoviste, Campia Turzii and Izhstal. Minority interest in losses of subsidiaries in 2003 consisted primarily of the share of minority shareholders in the net losses of Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, Beloretsk Metallurgical Plant and Mechel Targoviste in the amount of $18.3 million. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2004, was $1,357.6 million, compared to $147.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, as a result of the factors explained above. Loss from discontinued operations We recognized a loss of $5.8 million in 2003 as a result of discontinued operations and loss on disposal of our interests in Uglemetbank, a Russian bank providing banking services to our coal subsidiaries, and Belov Insurance Company, an insurance company providing life and property insurance to our coal subsidiaries, which we had committed to discontinue and sell as of December 31, 2002. Since we have started accounting for Mechel Zeljezara as discontinued operations, $3.4 million of loss was recognized as loss from discontinued operations in 2003 (see note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements). Loss from discontinued operations incurred in 2004 was $15.2 million, all related to Mechel Zeljezara. Extraordinary gain In accordance with SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142, the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price (after reducing the value of non-current assets to zero) in the amount of $5.7 million which was related to the acquisitions of minority interests in Mechel Campia Turzii in June 2003 was recorded as extraordinary gain, net of tax, in 2003. In 2004, gain in the amount of $0.3 million arose for the reasons set above and was related to the acquisitions of minority interests in Krasnogorsk Open Pit Mine on different dates from October 12 through December 30, 2004. Changes in accounting principle Upon adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, we recorded approximately $3.8 million, including tax benefit, as a charge to cumulative effective changes in accounting principles. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Net income For the reasons set forth above, our net income increased in the year ended December 31, 2004, by $1,199.2 million, or 835.6%, from $143.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, to $1,342.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. 101 Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital requirements Our principal on-going financing requirements are to finance our mining operations and production of steel and steel products, and to fund the following major activities: · Future growth through acquisitions; · Capital expenditures, including the purchase of equipment, modernization of facilities; · Retirement of our short-term and portions of our long-term debt; · Changes in working capital; and · General corporate purposes. We anticipate that acquisitions, capital expenditures and repayments of outstanding debt will represent the most significant uses of funds for the next several years. We continue to consider acquisitions as one of our major growth strategies. Historically, funding of this strategy came from cash flows from existing operations, external financing sources and our shareholders in the form of contributions to our charter capital. We intend to finance acquisitions in the future through cash flow generated by our business, as well as external debt. Our business is heavily dependent on plant and machinery for the production of steel and steel products, as well as investments in our mining operations. Investments to maintain and expand production facilities are, accordingly, an important priority and have a significant effect on our cash flows and future results of operations. We expect our capital expenditures to increase significantly in the next few years. See Item
