Audit Committee Under Korean law and our articles of incorporation, we are required to have an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may be composed of three or more directors; all members of the Audit Committee must be Outside Directors. Audit Committee members must also meet the applicable independence criteria set forth under the rules and regulations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Employees As of December 31, 2008, we had 29,730 employees, including 13,023 persons employed by our subsidiaries, almost all of whom were employed within Korea. Of the total number of employees, approximately 80% are technicians and skilled laborers and 20% are administrative staff. We use subcontractors for maintenance, cleaning and transport activities. We had 28,543 employees, including 11,236 persons employed by our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2007, and 28,297 employees, including 10,774 persons employed by our subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2006. To improve operational efficiency and increase labor productivity, we plan to reduce the number of our employees in future years through natural attrition. However, we expect the number of persons employed by our subsidiaries in growth industries to increase in the future. We consider our relations with our work force to be excellent. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike. Wages of our employees are among the highest of manufacturing companies in Korea. In addition to a base monthly wage, employees receive periodic bonuses and allowances. Base wages are determined annually following consultation between the management and employee representatives, who are currently elected outside the framework of the POSCO labor union. A labor union was formed by our employees in June 1988. Union membership peaked at 19,026 employees at the beginning of 1991, but has steadily declined since then. As of December 31, 2008, only 17 of our employees were members of the POSCO labor union. We maintain a retirement plan, as required by Korean labor law, pursuant to which employees terminating their employment after one year or more of service are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment based on the length of their service and their total compensation at the time of termination. We are required to transfer a portion of retirement and severance benefit amounts accrued by our employees to the National Pension Fund. The amounts so transferred reduce the retirement and severance benefit amounts payable to retiring employees by us at the time of their retirement. We also provide a wide range of fringe benefits to our employees, including housing, housing loans, company-provided hospitals and schools, a company-sponsored pension program, an employee welfare fund, industrial disaster insurance, and cultural and athletic facilities. As of December 31, 2008, our employees owned, through our employee stock ownership association, approximately 0.01% of our common stock in their association accounts and 3.99% of our common stock in their employee accounts. 51 Table of Contents Item 6.E.
