Item 1A. Risk Factors In analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors. Our results of operations are significantly dependent on economic conditions and related uncertainties. Commercial banking is affected, directly and indirectly, by domestic and international economic and political conditions and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, real estate values, government monetary policy, international conflicts, the actions of terrorists and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in interest rates, in particular, could adversely affect our net interest income and have a number of other adverse effects on our operations, as discussed in the immediately succeeding risk factor. Adverse economic conditions also could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures and nonperforming assets and a decrease in the value of the property or other collateral which secures our loans, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and related uncertainties in Wisconsin and contiguous counties in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois because we derive substantially all of our loans, deposits and other business from this area. Accordingly, we remain subject to the risks associated with prolonged declines in national or local economies. Changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operations of financial institutions such as us are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; and the fair value of the derivatives carried on our balance sheet, derivative hedge effectiveness testing and the amount of ineffectiveness recognized in our earnings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Although we believe that the estimated maturities of our interest-earning assets currently are well balanced in relation to the estimated maturities of our interest-bearing liabilities (which involves various estimates 25 Table of Contents as to how changes in the general level of interest rates will impact these assets and liabilities), there can be no assurance that our profitability would not be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates. There are increased risks involved with multi-family residential, commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer lending activities. Our lending activities include loans secured by existing multi-family residential and commercial real estate. In addition, we originate loans for the construction of multi-family residential real estate and land acquisition and development loans. Multi-family residential, commercial real estate and construction lending generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances, the dependency on successful completion or operation of the project for repayment, the difficulties in estimating construction costs and loan terms which often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at stated maturity. Our lending activities also include commercial business loans and leases to small to medium businesses, which generally are secured by various equipment, machinery and other corporate assets, and a wide variety of consumer loans, including home improvement loans, home equity loans, education loans and loans secured by automobiles, boats, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and other personal property. Although commercial business loans and leases and consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interests rates than mortgage loans, they generally involve more risk than mortgage loans because of the nature of, or in certain cases the absence of, the collateral which secures such loans. Additional increases in our level of non-performing assets will continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Weakening conditions in the real estate sector have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our loan portfolio. Loans classified as non-performing assets (consisting of non-accrual loans, non-performing real estate held for development and sale, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets) increased to $109.5 million, or 2.13% of total assets, at March 31, 2008 from $54.5 million, or 1.20% of total assets, at March 31, 2007, and $15.7 million, or 0.37% of total assets, at March 31, 2006. In addition, loans classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss totaled $143.9 million (including $104.1 million of impaired loans) at March 31, 2008, compared to $61.1 million at March 31, 2007 and $15.8 million at March 31, 2006. If loans that are currently non-performing further deteriorate or loans that are currently performing become non-performing, we may need to continue to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The increased time and expense associated with the work out of non-performing assets and potential non-performing assets also could adversely affect our operations. Our allowance for losses on loans and leases may not be adequate to cover probable losses. As our level of non-performing loans increased significantly in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 we have incurred increased provisions for loan losses, which amounted to $22.6 million, $11.3 million and $3.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our allowance for loan losses increased to $38.3 million, or 0.87% of total loans, at March 31, 2008 from $20.5 million, or 0.50% of total loans, at March 31, 2007 and $15.6 million, or 0.41% of total loans, at March 2006. Although we have established an allowance for loan losses which we believe is adequate to offset probable losses on our existing loans and leases, there can be no assurance that any future declines in real estate market conditions and values, general economic conditions or changes in regulatory policies will not require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business and operations. We and the Bank are subject to extensive federal governmental supervision and regulation, which are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to changes in laws, as well as changes in regulations, governmental policies and accounting principles. The effects of any such potential changes cannot be predicted but could adversely affect the business and operations of us and our subsidiaries in the future. 26 Table of Contents We face strong competition which may adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects and areas of our business from banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies. We also compete with non-financial institutions, including retail stores that maintain their own credit programs and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers. Certain of our competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of commercial banking services. Competition from both bank and non-bank organizations will continue. Our ability to successfully compete may be reduced if we are unable to make technological advances. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. As a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customersÂ’ needs by using technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products to our customers. Many of our competitors have far greater resources than we have to invest in technology. We and our banking subsidiary are subject to capital and other requirements which restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders depends to a large extent upon the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to restrictions under federal laws and regulations. In addition, the Bank must maintain certain capital levels, which may restrict the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights and are subject to potential dilution. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide any shareholder with a preemptive right to subscribe for additional shares of common stock upon any increase thereof. Thus, upon the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other voting securities of the Company or securities convertible into common stock or other voting securities, shareholders may be unable to maintain their pro rata voting or ownership interest in us. Our real estate operations have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The Corporation conducts real estate operations through Investment Directions, Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary, which invests in various real estate subsidiaries and partnerships and conducts real estate development and sales throughout California, Texas and Minnesota. As a result of weakening conditions in the real estate market and reduced sales of its properties, the Corporation has incurred losses from the operations of its real estate subsidiaries in recent years, which are expected to continue unless the real estate market improves. Losses from its real estate operations amounted to $2.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additional losses from our real estate operations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None
