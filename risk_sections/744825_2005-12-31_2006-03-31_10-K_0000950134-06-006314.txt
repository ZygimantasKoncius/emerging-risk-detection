ITEM 1a. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Companys Capital Investment in Each Gamma Knife Unit is Substantial Each Gamma Knife unit requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment. The Market for the Gamma Knife is Limited There is a limited market for the Gamma Knife. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2005 there were 103 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which 21 units are owned by us, and 234 units in operation worldwide. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at a significant number of sites in the future. The Company Has a High Level of Debt The Companys business is capital intensive and it has traditionally financed each Gamma Knife with debt. The combined long term debt and present value of capital leases totals $25,082,000 and is collateralized by the Gamma Knife units and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of the financed equipment. This high level of debt may adversely affect the Companys ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If default on debt occurs in the future, the Companys creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife unit with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default. The Market is Competitive There are currently three companies (in addition to our company) that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe there are no competitor companies that currently have more than six Gamma Knife units in operation. The Companys relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to such customers and may also lose future sales to its competitors. There can be no 12 Table of Contents assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units. There Are Alternatives to the Gamma Knife There are several methods of radiosurgery (including the modified linear accelerator) as well as conventional neurosurgery that compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery modality instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition, neurosurgeons who are primarily responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth. The Companys Revenue Could Decline if Federal Reimbursement Rates are Lowered The amount reimbursed to medical centers for each Gamma Knife treatment may decline in the future. The reimbursement decrease may come from federally mandated programs (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) or other third party payor groups. Fifteen of the Companys existing contracts are reimbursed by the medical center to the Company on a fee per use basis. The primary risk under this type of contract is that the actual volume of procedures could be less than projected. However, a significant reimbursement rate reduction may result in the Company restructuring certain of its existing contracts. There are also six contracts where the Company receives revenue based directly on the amount of reimbursement received for procedures performed. Revenue under those contracts and any future contracts with revenue based directly on reimbursement amounts will be impacted by any reimbursement rate change. Some of the Companys future contracts for Gamma Knife services may have revenue based on such reimbursement rates instead of a fee for service basis. There can be no assurance that future changes in healthcare regulations and reimbursement rates will not directly or indirectly adversely affect the Companys Gamma Knife revenue. New Technology and Products Could Result in Equipment Obsolescence There is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgraded Gamma Knife which costs approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic Positioning System (APS), and therefore involves less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduced a new upgrade, the model 4C. Twelve of our existing Gamma Knife units include APS and eight of our existing Gamma Knife units are upgradeable. The cost to upgrade existing units to the new model 4C Gamma Knife with APS is estimated to be approximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our Contract With Elekta May Limit Our Activities ASHS owns 81% of GKF and the minority interest is owned by Elekta. The operating agreement governing GKF contains restrictions on our ability to engage in financing 13 Table of Contents ...alternative stereotactic radiosurgery equipment to the Gamma Knife. In the past, we and Elekta have had different interpretations of the scope of this restriction in the operating agreement. If Elektas position were to prevail, this provision may limit the activities that ASHS undertakes in the future.
