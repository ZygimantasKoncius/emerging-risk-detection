ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: Industry Risks: Pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including:  Capacity utilizationOur Industrial Chemicals businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. As a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. 18 Table of Contents  CompetitionAll of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to raise prices or successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. Additionally in Agricultural Products, competition from generic producers has increased as a number of significant product patents have expired in the last decade.  Changes in our customer baseOur customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. Our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk.  Climatic conditionsOur Agricultural Products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely affect crop pricing and pest infestations. The nature of these events makes them difficult to predict.  Changing regulatory environmentChanges in the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States and the European Union could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets.  Raw Materials and Energy costsOur operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. We may not be able to fully offset the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs through price increases or productivity improvements.  Supply ArrangementsCertain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals, and while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce product.  Unforeseen economic and political changeOur business could be adversely affected by unforeseen economic and political changes in the international markets where we compete including: war, terrorism, civil unrest, inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the United States or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; change in governmental laws and regulations and the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control.  Market Access RiskOur results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. In certain agricultural product segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. Where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios.  Litigation and environmental risksCurrent reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may prove inadequate.  Hazardous MaterialsWe manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature and while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner if they are mishandled or released into the environment it could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us.  Production hazardsOur facilities are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business. Technology Risks:  Failure to make continued improvements in our product technology and new product introductions could impede our competitive position, particularly in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals.  Failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. 19 Table of Contents Financial Risks:  We are an international company and therefore face foreign exchange rate risks. We are particularly sensitive to the euro and the Brazilian real. To a lesser extent, we are sensitive to Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese yen.  In Brazil our customers face a combination of economic factors that could result in cash flow pressures that lead to slower payments.  We have significant deferred income tax assets. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon, among other things, our future performance and our ability to successfully implement our tax planning strategies.  We have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities.  Our results incorporate the financial performance of our equity affiliates. As such, our influence, though significant, is exercised in concert with our partners; accordingly, the performance of these investments is not under our control.  Obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. To the extent our plans actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None
