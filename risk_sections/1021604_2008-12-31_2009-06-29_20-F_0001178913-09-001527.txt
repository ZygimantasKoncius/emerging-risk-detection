Risk Factors contained in this annual report. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Item 18. Financial Statements of this annual report. A. OPERATING RESULTS The following discussion and analysis is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 18. Financial Statements. Overview We design, develop and sell contactless microprocessor-based smart card systems. Our headquarters and main research and development activities are in Israel. Our sales and marketing efforts are directed from our Israeli headquarters with additional sales support offices located in U.S. subsidiary, OTI America, located in Fort Lee, New Jersey, Europe, South Africa and the Far East. Our packaging, assembly and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel, Germany and the Far East. Since our incorporation in 1990, we have focused on the development of our core technologies and our OTI Platform-based products. We currently offer three lines of products, each of which constitutes a complete system, as well as components (such as smart cards, inlays, readers and machines ) that we sell to original equipment manufacturers, OEMs, as well as other cards manufactures and companies for sale or incorporation into their own products. Our three complete system product lines include:  Payments Solutions: we offer financial institutions a cashless system and loyalty program to replace cash, which includes the PayPass system that we are installing for MasterCard, our EasyPark system and our mass transit payment system as well as cards, inlays and machineries for the production of SmartID solutions as well as production line for SIM cards;  Petroleum Systems: OTIs EasyFuel is a wireless, cashless, cardless, and paperless fuel management and petroleum solution which includes both our gasoline management system, or GMS, and our EasyFuel systems; and  Smart ID Solutions: OTIs solutions for credentialing, identifying and verifying individuals combine the capability to support biometric identification with the portability of smart cards. We also offer cards, inlays and machineries for the production of SmartID solutions. In 2003 we introduced and began to realize revenues from EasyFuel, our contactless petroleum system, which we expect to account for an increasing proportion of our petroleum system sales. In 1998, we were awarded a contract for the first of our micropayments systems, an electronic parking payment system which we refer to as EasyPark. We began to deploy EasyPark in 2000 and completed deployment of the first system in June 2001. We deployed our first mass transit micropayments system in China during 2000 and in the United States in 2003. In 2002, we began to realize nonrecurring engineering revenues from the PayPass micropayments system that we are installing for MasterCard International and we began to recognize product sale revenues from that system in 2004. We began to market components for incorporation into the products of OEMs with our acquisition of InterCard Systemelectronic in June 2000. During 2006, 2007 and 2008, product sales to OEMs accounted for $7.8 million, $8.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of our total revenues. We began marketing cards, inlays and machineries following our acquisitions of MCT, e-Pilot and POE . 39 We have reported net losses for each year that we have been in business, and we expect to incur full year losses at least through 2009. Our business tends to be seasonal, with greater sales in the third and the fourth quarters of every year, we do not anticipate having net earnings for either of the first two quarters of 2009 and we also cannot assure you that we will be profitable in either of the last two quarters of 2009, or afterwards. Sources of Revenue We have historically derived a substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of our products, including both complete systems and OEM components. A substantial majority of our revenues has been, and is likely to continue to be, from the sale of complete systems and its components. We anticipate that revenues from sales will continue to represent the substantial majority of our revenues in the future. In addition, we generate revenues from licensing and transaction fees, and also, less significantly, from non-recurring engineering, customer services and technical support. During the past three years, the revenues that we have derived from sales and licensing and transaction fees have been as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 Sales $ 35,171 87 % $ 40,854 94 % $ 37,582 93 % Licensing and transaction fees 5,382 13 % 2,631 6 % 2,635 7 % $ 40,553 100 % $ 43,485 100 % $ 40,217 100 % Sales increased by $5.7 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased by $3.3 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in 2007 is mainly attributed to an increase in sales of Petroleum products, Payments products and its components, and OEM. The decrease in 2008 is mainly attributed to decrease in sales of Payments products and its components. Licensing and transaction fees include one-time and periodic payments for manufacturing or distribution rights for our products. Transaction fees are paid by customers based on the volume of transactions processed by systems that contain our products. The decrease in 2007 as compare to 2006 is primarily consisted of a decrease in transaction fees from the China ID project. We expect to generate additional revenues from transaction fees in the future as the installation and usage of systems that contain our products become more widespread. We have historically derived revenues from different geographical areas. The following table sets forth our revenues, by dollar amount (in thousands) and as a percentage of revenues in different geographical areas, during the past three years: Africa Europe Far East 2006 $ 3,200 8 % $ 14,065 35 % $ 11,958 29 % 2007 $ 4,710 11 % $ 17,924 41 % $ 9,024 21 % 2008 $ 5,423 13 % $ 19,258 48 % $ 6,364 16 % North, Central and South America Israel 2006 $ 8,174 20 % $ 3,156 8 % 2007 $ 7,569 17 % $ 4,258 10 % 2008 $ 5,100 13 % $ 4,072 10 % We anticipate that, over time, the revenues that we derive from the Americas will grow both in absolute amounts and as a percentage of our total revenues. Our revenues derived from outside the U.S., which are primarily received in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, will have a varying impact upon our total revenues, as a result of fluctuations in such currencies exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. 40 Cost of revenues and gross margin Our cost of revenues, by revenue source, and gross profit, for each of the past three years were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): Year ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 Cost of revenues Sales $ 21,871 $ 25,918 $ 24,743 Licensing and transaction fees - - - Total cost of revenues $ 21,871 $ 25,918 $ 24,743 Gross profit $ 18,682 $ 17,567 $ 15,474 Sales. Cost of revenues relating to sales consists primarily of materials, as well as salaries, fees payable to subcontractors and related costs for our technical staff who assemble our products. The increase in 2007 is primarily the result of increased sales which generated corresponding increased costs, and due to increase in costs associated with the revenue mix in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in 2008 is primarily the result of decreased sales which generated corresponding decreased costs. Licensing and transaction fees. Licensing and transaction fees revenues do not have directly attributable cost of revenues. The only costs incurred to initiate the project represent selling and marketing expenses and are classified as such in the consolidated statement of operations. Operating expenses Our operating expenses and operating loss for each of the past three years were as follows (dollar amounts in thousands): Year ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 Operating expenses Research and development $ 7,065 $ 12,265 $ 11,129 Selling and marketing 7,072 9,670 11,875 General and administrative 11,948 17,593 14,274 Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 821 1,314 2,794 Impairment of goodwill - - 24,217 Gain from sale of subsidiary (122 ) - - Total operating expenses 26,784 40,842 64,289 Operating loss $ (8,102 ) $ (23,275 ) $ (48,815 ) Research and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of our research and development staff, as well as subcontracting expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to a $3.6 million increase in expenses related to salaries that resulted from increase of 17 employees, mainly following the acquisitions of InSeal during May 2006 and the IPS division of Vuance (formerly SuperCom) which took place on December 31, 2006, a $862,000 increase in share-based compensation expenses, in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R), and due to a $845,000 increase in expenses related to subcontractors, and rental expenses. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in expenses related to salaries resulting from a $426,000 decrease in share-based compensation expenses, in accordance with SFAS 123R and from a decrease in number of research and development employees. Our research and development expenses may increase in the future as we continue to develop new products and new applications for our existing products. 41 Selling and marketing. Our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and substantially all of the expenses of our sales and marketing subsidiaries and offices in the United States, South Africa, the Far East and Europe, as well as expenses related to advertising, professional expenses, participation in exhibitions and tradeshows. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in expenses related to salaries that resulted from an increase of employees, mainly following the acquisitions of InSeal during May 2006 and the IPS division of Vuance (formerly SuperCom) which took place on December 31, 2006, and due to a $678,000 increase in expenses related to our marketing efforts in new and existing markets. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in professional expenses resulting from marketing services related to existing projects and future projects, legal expenses related to the Smartrac law suit and increase in compensation expenses, in compliance with SFAS 123R and EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services (EITF 96-18). Our selling and marketing expenses may increase in the future as we continue to expand our local sales and marketing subsidiaries, open new offices and in the event that we hire additional personnel. General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of our executive management and financial and administrative staff. These expenses also include costs of our professional advisors (such as lawyers and accountants), office expenses and insurance and vehicle expenses, which have collectively grown with the scope, magnitude and complexity of our business, and provision for doubtful accounts. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily attributed to a $2.5 million provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2007, a $1.2 million increase in share-based compensation expenses, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, and due to a $1 million increase in expenses related to professional and rental expenses. The decrease in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in provision for doubtful accounts, a $947,000 decrease in share-based compensation expenses, in compliance with SFAS 123R and EITF 96-18, and a $703,000 decrease in professional expenses. General corporate and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we continue to expand our operations. Amortization and impairment of intangible assets. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily due to a $1.4 million impairment charge against other intangible assets (customers contracts and relationships) acquired in acquisition of InSeal SAS. Impairment of goodwill. We conducted a goodwill impairment test on the goodwill acquired. The test was based on our single reporting unit structure. As a result of the decrease in our market capitalization in 2008 and deteriorating global economy, we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value. We further concluded that all of the goodwill acquired had been impaired and therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $24.2 million. Financing income (expenses), net Financing income consists primarily of interest earned on our investments in U.S. treasury securities and foreign exchange gains. Financing expenses consist primarily of interest payable on bank loans and foreign exchange losses. The decrease in financing income is mainly due to decrease in interest earned on investments in U.S. treasury securities and the increase in financing expenses is mainly due to an increase in interest expenses from short term loans and credit. Our financing income, net for each of the past three years, has been as follows (in thousands): Year ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 Financing income $ 2,459 $ 2,800 $ 561 Financing expenses (747 ) (938 ) (1,089 ) Financing income (expenses), net $ 1,712 $ 1,862 $ (528 ) 42 Net loss Our net loss increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in our operating expenses as mentioned above and a decrease in our gross margin primarily due to a decrease in revenues from licensing and transaction fees. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily due to an increase in the Companys operating expenses, mainly due to the goodwill impairment charge as mention above, increase in financial expenses, net as mentioned above, decrease in gross profit resulting from decrease in sales, decrease in minority share in loss of subsidiaries and increase in equity loss of affiliated company. Our net loss for each of the past three years has been as follows (in thousands): Year ended December 31 2006 2007 2008 Net loss $ (6,604 ) $ (20,643 ) $ (49,995 ) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and results of operations. To fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, we believe it is important to understand our revenue recognition policy, our policy with respect to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and our policy with respect to stock-based compensation. Revenue recognition. We recognize product sale revenues upon delivery, provided there is persuasive evidence of an agreement and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable and no further obligation exists. In the case of nonrecurring engineering, revenue is recognized upon completion of testing and approval of the customization of the product by the customer and provided that no further obligation exists. Technology license revenues are recognized at the time the technology and license are delivered to the customer, collection is probable, the fee is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, no significant obligation remains under the sale or licensing agreement and no significant customer acceptance requirements exist after delivery of the technology. We recognize revenues from customer services and technical support as the services are rendered ratably over the period of the related contract. We recognize transaction fees as they are earned, based on actual usage. Our revenue recognition policies are consistently applied for all revenues recognized. Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, as of December every year, in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need to be performed. 43 The Company conducted its goodwill impairment test on the goodwill acquired. The test was based on the Companys single reporting unit structure. As a result of the decrease in the Companys market capitalization in 2008 and the deteriorating global economy, the Company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value. The Company further concluded that all the goodwill acquired had been impaired and therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2008, it recorded an impairment charge of $24.2 million. No impairment losses were recorded in 2007 and 2006. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to seven years. Impairment of long-lived assets. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 144 (SFAS 144), Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. As of December 2008 the Company conducted its impairment test on the intangible assets recognized in the acquisition of InSeal, as a result of an uncertainty relating to a customer of InSeal and the future revenues from that customer. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. No impairment charges were recoded in 2007 and 2006. Other intangible assets, net, amounted to approximately $2.5 million as of December 31, 2008. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for our other intangible assets. Stock option plans. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock based employee and director compensation by using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB 25) and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123). Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess of the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant over the exercise price and was recognized over the scheduled vesting. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under the modified-prospective-transition method, compensation cost is recognized on a prospective basis for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. For share-based payment awards granted after January 1, 2006, the Company recognizes compensation cost based on estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In accordance with the modified prospective method, the Companys consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the Companys loss before taxes and minority interests and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006, are $2,354,000 larger, and loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 is $0.17 larger, than if it had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB 25. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the $833,000 in Additional Paid-In Capital and the offsetting amount in Deferred Stock-Based Compensation, that were both reflected in shareholders equity at December 31, 2005, have been reversed as required by SFAS 123R. The net effect had no change in total shareholders equity. The critical assumptions relate to determining the expected life of the option, considering the outcome of service-related conditions (i.e., vesting requirements and forfeitures), expected volatility of the underlying stock as an estimate of the future price fluctuation for a term commensurate with the expected life of the option, expected dividend yield on the underlying stock, commensurate with the expected life of the option, and the risk-free interest rate commensurate with the expected term of the option. 44 SFAS No. 123R requires that the option pricing model used consider managements expectations about the life of the option, future dividends, and stock price volatility. Both the volatility and dividend yield components should reflect reasonable expectations commensurate with the expected life of the option. To determine the expected volatility, we generally begin with calculating historical volatility over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the options. The expected dividend yield on the underlying stock for all relevant periods is zero since there is no history of paying dividends. The expected life of an employee stock option award was estimated based on reasonable facts and assumptions on the grant date. These estimates incorporate significant judgment in determining the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. During 2008 most of the options were granted with a par value exercise price. Due to the par value nominal amount of NIS 0.1, the fair value of these options was estimated to be equal to the Companys share price as of the day of grant. Recently Issued Accounting Guidance In February, 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159). The statement allows the Company to irrevocably choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The adoption of FAS 159 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. In June 2007, the FASB reached a final consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 07-3, Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities (EITF 07-03). The consensus reached by the FASB requires companies involved in research and development activities to capitalize such non-refundable advance payments for goods and services pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement because the right to receive those services in the future represents a probable future economic benefit. Those advance payments will be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed. The consensus on EITF 07-03 is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the provisions of EITF 07-03 did not have an impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141R, Business Combinations (Statement 141R) and FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment to ARB No. 51 (Statement 160). Statements 141R and 160 require most identifiable assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and require noncontrolling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity, which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. Both statements are effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. Statement 141R will be applied to business combinations occurring after the effective date. Statement 160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. The Company will adopt the guidance in Statement 141R and Statement 160 to future transactions. The Company will follow upon adoption the presentation and disclosure requirements with respect to minority interests in subsidiaries, this will result in a reclassification of immaterial amounts from minority interest liability classified balance to an equity account. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS 157), for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS 157 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delays the effective date of SFAS 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. On January 1, 2009, the Company will be required to apply the provisions of SFAS 157 to fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of applying these provisions on its financial position and results of operations. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, which was effective immediately. FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in cases where the market for a financial instrument is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining fair value in those circumstances. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-3 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. 45 In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. Statement 161 requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments, as well as any details of credit-risk-related contingent features contained within derivatives. Statement 161 also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements, how the provisions of Statement 133 have been applied, and the impact that hedges have on an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Statement 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company believes that the impact, if any, of adopting Statement 161 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statement. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement 142. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company believes that the impact, if any, of adopting FSP FAS 142-3 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statement. In June 2008, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-5, Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entitys Own Stock. This EITF Issue provides guidance on the determination of whether such instruments are classified in equity or as a derivative instrument. The Company will adopt the provisions of EITF 07-5 on January 1, 2009 and expect that the impact, if any, of adopting EITF 07-5 will not have a material impact on the Companys financial statement. In November 2008, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations. EITF 08-6 continues to follow the accounting for the initial carrying value of equity method investments in APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, which is based on a cost accumulation model and generally excludes contingent consideration. EITF 08-6 also specifies that other-than-temporary impairment testing by the investor should be performed at the investment level and that a separate impairment assessment of the underlying assets is not required. An impairment charge by the investee should result in an adjustment of the investors basis of the impaired asset for the investors pro-rata share of such impairment. In addition, EITF 08-6 reached a consensus on how to account for an issuance of shares by an investee that reduces the investors ownership share of the investee. An investor should account for such transactions as if it had sold a proportionate share of its investment with any gains or losses recorded through earnings. EITF 08-6 also addresses the accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method after adoption of Statement 160. EITF 08-6 affirms the existing guidance in APB 18, which requires cessation of the equity method of accounting and application of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, or the cost method under APB 18, as appropriate. EITF 08-6 is effective for transactions occurring on or after December 15, 2008. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of EITF 08-6 will materially impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 165, Subsequent Events, addressing accounting and disclosure requirements related to subsequent events. Statement 165 requires management to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial statements are either issued or available to be issued, depending on the companys expectation of whether it will widely distribute its financial statements to its shareholders and other financial statement users. Companies will be required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. Statement 165 is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009 and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of Statement 165 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 46 B. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal sources of liquidity since our inception have been sales of equity securities, borrowings from banks, and cash from the exercise of options and warrants. We had cash and cash equivalents of $27.2 million as of December 31, 2008 and $35.5 million as of December 31, 2007.

Market Risks Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and currency fluctuations. In order to limit our exposure, we may enter, from time to time, into various derivative transactions. Our objective is to reduce exposure and fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. It is our policy and practice from time to time to use derivative financial instruments only to limit exposure. 47 Interest Rate Risks We are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates, relating primarily from our loan obligations to banks. We do not currently use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2008, we had fixed interest rate loan obligations of $2.3 million. Of this amount, $1.4 million was denominated in euro, $703,000 was denominated in USD, $120,000 was denominated in New Israeli Shekel, $49,000 was denominated in Polish Zloty and $41,000 was denominated in South African Rand. These loans will be repaid during the next five years. The carrying values of the loans are equivalent to or approximate their fair market value as they bear interest at approximate market rates. Impact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuations Our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We generate a significant portion of our revenues and we incur some of our expenses in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in countries in which we are active other than the United States will exceed the rate of devaluation of such countries currencies in relation to the dollar or that the timing of this devaluation will lag behind inflation in such countries. To date, we have been affected by changes in the rate of inflation or the exchange rates of other countries currencies compared to the dollar, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future. The annual rate of inflation (deflation) in Israel was 3.8% in 2008, 3.4% in 2007 and (0.1%) in 2006. The NIS revalued by approximately 1.1% and 9.0% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of InterCard Systemelectronic, Inseal SAS and PARX France is euro and of ASEC Spolka Akcyjna is the Polish Zloty and the functional currency of MCT is the Chinese Yuan Renminbi. Significantly all of these subsidiaries revenues are earned, and significantly all of their expenses are incurred, in their functional currencies. To the extent that there are fluctuations between the euro, the Polish Zloty and/or the Chinese Yuan Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, the translation adjustment will be included in our consolidated changes in shareholders equity and will not impact the consolidated statement of operations. We cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future. Corporate Tax Rate On July 25, 2005 the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, passed the Law for the Amendment of the Income Tax Ordinance (No.147 and Temporary Order)  2005, or the Amendment. The Amendment provides for a gradual reduction in the company tax rate in the following manner: in 2006  31%, in 2007  29%, in 2008  27%, in 2009  26% and from 2010 onward the tax rate will be 25%. Furthermore, as from 2010, upon reduction of the company tax rate to 25%, real capital gains will be subject to tax of 25%. As of December 31, 2008, our net operating loss carry-forwards for Israeli tax purposes amounted to approximately $84.4 million. Under Israeli law, net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely and offset against certain future taxable income. Since we have incurred tax losses through December 31, 2008, we have not yet utilized the tax benefits for which we are eligible under the Approved Enterprise status. $4.5 million of our investment programs in buildings, equipment and production facilities have been granted Approved Enterprise status and we are, therefore, eligible for a tax exemption under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959. Subject to compliance with applicable requirements, the portion of our income derived from the Approved Enterprise programs is tax-exempt for a period of the earliest of (1) ten years commencing in the first year in which it generates taxable income, (2) 14 years from the date of approval or (3) 12 years from the date of beginning of production. If we do not comply with these requirements, the tax benefits may be cancelled and we may be required to refund the amount of benefits received, in whole or in part, with the addition of linkage differences to the Israeli consumer price index and interest. As of the date of this annual report, we believe that we are in compliance with these conditions. Government of Israel Support Programs Until 2005 we participated in programs offered by the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (OCS) that support research and development activities. Under the terms of these programs, a royalty of 3% to 3.5% of the sales of products must be paid to the OCS, beginning with the commencement of sales of products developed with grant funds and ending when the dollar value of the grant is repaid. In 2006 we decided to cease our participation with the OCS. 48 Royalties payable with respect to grants received under programs approved after January 1, 1999, however, will be subject to interest on the dollar-linked value of the total grants received at an annual rate of LIBOR applicable to dollar deposits. As of December 31, 2008, we have received a total of $5.0 million from the OCS net of royalties paid to it (or accrued for). The terms of Israeli government participation also require that the manufacturing of products developed with government grants be performed in Israel, unless the OCS has granted special approval. If the OCS consents to the manufacture of the products outside Israel, we may be required to pay increased royalties, ranging from 120% to 300% of the amount of the OCS grant, depending on the percentage of foreign manufacture. These restrictions continue to apply even after we have paid the full amount of royalties payable in respect of the grants. Based upon the aggregate grants received to date, we expect that we will continue to pay royalties to the OCS to the extent of our sales of our products and related services for the foreseeable future. Separate OCS consent is required to transfer to third parties technologies developed through projects in which the government participates. These restrictions do not apply to exports from Israel of products developed with these technologies. C. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC. Discussed above in "Item 5.A. Overview." D. TREND INFORMATION Discussed above in "Item 5.A. Overview." E. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. F. TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of December 31, 2008, we and our subsidiaries had contractual obligations which are expected to affect our consolidated cash flow in future periods as follows: (in thousands) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and thereafter Total Operating lease obligations $ 751 $ 513 $ 464 $ 455 $ 471 $ 2,654 Long-term debt obligations $ 580 $ 528 $ 272 $ 128 $ 834 $ 2,342 Deferred tax liability $ 82 $ 36 $ 19 $ 12 $ 53 $ 202 Total $ 1,413 $ 1,077 $ 755 $ 595 $ 1,358 $ 5,198 We shall also pay royalties to the Office of the Chief Scientist as discussed above in B, Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our liability for severance pay for some of our Israeli employees is calculated pursuant to Israeli severance pay law based on the most recent salary of the employee multiplied by the number of years of employment, as of the balance sheet date. Those employees are entitled to one months salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof. Certain senior executives are entitled to receive additional severance pay. Our liability for those Israeli employees is partially provided for by monthly deposits for insurance policies and by an accrual. The value of these policies is recorded as an asset in our balance sheet. The deposited funds include profits and losses accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to Israeli Severance Pay Law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the cash redemption value of these policies. Our total liability, net of deposited funds, at December 31, 2008 was $2.5 million. Timing of payment of this liability is dependent on timing of the departure of the employees. For additional information on our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, under long-term bank loans and operating leases, see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements. For a description of liens on our assets see Note 9C to our consolidated financial statements. 49 ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES A.

The employment agreements of Moshe Aduk and Nehemya Itay, each dated July 1, 1999, provide for a five-year term ending on June 30, 2004, and were extended automatically for an undetermined employment period. These individuals may terminate their employment, and we may terminate their employment for reasonable and justifiable cause, in either case upon six months notice. In the event of termination, these individuals are entitled to receive severance pay equal to twice the rate of one months current salary multiplied by the number of years of employment. In the event we terminate the employment of either Mr. Aduk or Mr. Itay, unless the termination occurred as a result of circumstances depriving them of the right to severance pay at law or as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty or a material breach of his confidentiality or noncompetition undertakings, we are required to continue paying each of them a monthly salary for three months following the notice period described above. Agreement with Ohad Bashan. The employment agreement of Ohad Bashan with OTI America, Inc., dated October 6, 2005, as was approved at our shareholders meeting dated November 12, 2005, and amended at our shareholders meetings dated July 27, 2007 and August 6, 2008, provides for a four-year term ending on August 24, 2009. On June 2007 the Company assumed his employment agreement and he was appointed as the President of the Company commencing in August 2007, pursuant to which he relocated from the U.S. to the Companys headquarters in Israel and stepped down from his office as the President of OTI America, however, remained his position as Chief Executive Officer and a director of OTI America, Inc. Mr. Bashan may terminate his employment on six months notice and we may terminate his employment upon six months notice. In the event we terminate his employment, Mr. Bashan shall be entitled to six months severance payments with full terms and benefits, and shall be entitled to severance payment in an amount equal to two monthly salaries for each year Mr. Bashan was employed with the Company or OTI America, in addition to all benefits and salary Mr. Bashan is entitled to during the six month period. In addition to his monthly compensation, Mr. Bashan is entitled to receive a special annual bonus of 0.5% of the annual sales in the Americas markets. The bonus is paid during the month of April of the following year of the actual sales, as recognized in OTIs financial statements. The total compensation that Mr. Bashan is entitled to under his employment agreement is paid to Mr. Bashan partially as a salary, in his capacity as an employee of the company, and partially as a service fee, in his capacity as a service provider. 53 C. BOARD PRACTICES Election of Directors; Appointment of Officers Our current board of directors consists of eight directors. Under our articles of association, our board of directors may not consist at any time of more than nine members. A majority of these directors must be non-executive directors, who are directors that are neither office holders nor our employees. Directors are appointed, removed or replaced, by a majority vote of our shareholders present in person or by proxy at a general meeting of shareholders. Once elected at a shareholders meeting, our directors, except our external directors, hold office until the first general meeting of shareholders held at least thirty six months after their election, except for Mr. Oded Bashan and Mr. Ronnie Gilboa who may not be replaced or removed unless by an affirmative vote of 75% of the Companys shareholders entitled to vote and voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting of shareholders. Incumbent directors may be reelected at that meeting. Unless contrary to the law, a director may be elected for consecutive terms. Under the new Israeli Companies Law, which entered into effect on February 1, 2000 (the Companies Law), the chief executive officer of a public company may not serve as a chairman of the board of directors, and vice versa, unless authorized by a general meeting of the shareholders and then only for a period of time that does not exceed three years. On August 24, 2006 our shareholders authorized our Chairman, Oded Bashan, to act as our Chief Executive Officer for an additional three-year period, after such date, we plan to recommend to our shareholders to authorize Mr. Bashan to act as our Chief Executive Officer for an additional 3-year period. Our board of directors appoints our chief executive officer. Each of our executive officers serves at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to the terms of any employment agreement, and holds office until his or her successor is elected or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Except for Ohad Bashan, our President and Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Executive Officer of OTI America, who is the son of Oded Bashan, our co-founder and chairman of our board of directors, none of our directors or executive officers has any family relationship with any other director or executive officer. External Directors The Israeli Companies Law requires Israeli companies with shares that have been offered to the public in or outside of Israel to appoint at least two external directors. No person may be appointed as an external director of a company if the person, or the persons relative, partner, employer or any entity under the persons control, has, or had within the two years preceding the persons appointment as an external director, any affiliation with the company or with any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the company. The term affiliation includes control, an employment relationship, a business or professional relationship maintained on a regular basis, or service as an office holder, excluding service as a director appointed to serve as an external director in a company that intends to make an initial offering of its shares to the public. The term office holder is defined as a director, general manager, chief business manager, deputy general manager, vice general manager, executive vice president, vice president, other manager directly subordinate to the general manager or any other person assuming the responsibilities of any of the foregoing positions, without regard to such persons title. Each person listed in the table above is an office holder. The external directors were not office holders until elected. In addition, no person may serve as an external director if that persons other positions or business activities create, or may create, a conflict of interest with the persons service as an external director or may otherwise interfere with the persons ability to serve as an external director. If, at the time an external director is appointed, all current members of the board of directors are of the same gender, then that external director must be of the other gender. Regulations promulgated under the Companies Law provide that the requirement of Israeli residency does not apply to the external directors of companies whose shares are listed for trading outside of Israel. External directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders meeting at which either the majority of shares voted at the meeting, including at least one-third of the shares held by non-controlling shareholders voted at the meeting, vote in favor of the election of the external director, or the total number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders voted against the election of the external director does not exceed one percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company. The initial term of an external director is three years and under legislation that apply to Israeli companies whose shares that have been offered to the public outside of Israel or traded on a stock exchange outside of Israel, may be extended for consecutive additional three year periods (unlike other public companies, in which only one additional three year period is allowed). External directors may only be removed by the same percentage of shareholders as is required for their election, or by a court, and then only if the external directors cease to meet the statutory qualifications for their appointment or if they violate their duty of loyalty to the company. If an external directorship becomes vacant, our board of directors is required under the Companies Law to call a shareholders meeting immediately to appoint a new external director. 54 A company may not appoint an external director as an office holder and may not employ or receive services from an external director, directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by that person, for two years following the termination of his or her service as an external director of that company. Each committee of our board of directors must include at least one external director and the audit committee must include all of the external directors. An external director is entitled to compensation as provided in regulations adopted under the Companies Law and is otherwise prohibited from receiving any other compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with services provided as an external director. In addition, the audit committee of our board of directors must include at least three independent directors within the meaning of the NASDAQ Global Market listing requirements. Our directors Raanan Ellran, Shlomo Toussia-Cohen, Eliezer Manor and Ora Setter, qualify as external directors under the Companies Law and independent directors under the NASDAQ Global Market listing requirements. In addition, our director Eli Akavia, CPA is qualified as an independent director under the NASDAQ Global Market listing requirements. Alternate Directors Under our articles of association, each of our directors, other than our external directors, may appoint, by written notice to us, any person to serve as an alternate director. Under the Companies Law, a current director cannot be appointed as an alternate director nor can a currently-serving alternate director be appointed as an alternate director. An alternate director has all the rights and duties of the director appointing him, unless the appointment of the alternate provides otherwise, and the right to remuneration. The alternate director may not act at any meeting at which the appointing director is present. Unless the time period or scope of the appointment is limited by the appointing director, the appointment is effective for all purposes, but expires upon the expiration of the appointing directors term. Currently, none of our directors has appointed any alternate directors. Directors Service Contracts Except directors who are also officers of the Company, none of our directors have any services contracts either with us, or with any of our subsidiaries, which provide for benefits upon termination of employment or service. Directors Compensation In accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, we pay each director (other than directors who are also officers of the Company) annual compensation in the amount of NIS 73,124 (around $17,410), and in addition an amount of NIS 2,813 (around $700) for each meeting of the board or any one of its committee attended in person (and 50% of this amount for each meeting attended via a conference call). In addition, we grant our directors, from time to time, options to purchase our ordinary shares, subject to the approval of our shareholders meeting. Board Committees Our Board of Directors has established an audit committee, compensation committee and steering committee. Compensation Committee Our board of directors established our compensation committee in July 1999. The duties of the compensation committee are to review the terms of employment of our senior management, to review and recommend to our board of directors the issuance and the allocation of options under our share option plans and to perform any other task delegated by our board of directors. 55 The current members of our compensation committee are Oded Bashan, Eliezer Manor, Shlomo Toussia-Cohen, Ora Setter, Raanan Ellran and Eli Akavia. Other than Oded Bashan, who serves as a member of our compensation committee, none of the members of our compensation committee or audit committee is currently, or has ever been at any time since our formation, an officer or employee of our company. Since our compensation committee is not comprised solely of independent directors, all compensation arrangements of our executive officers are determined by a majority of our independent directors in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Steering Committee Our board of directors established our steering committee in November 2004. The duties of the steering committee were to review the deployment of our company towards the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Following the establishment of the required procedure pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we concluded that the steering committee is no longer required. Audit Committee Our board of directors established our audit committee in July 1999. The Companies Law requires public companies to appoint an audit committee consisting of at least three directors, including all the external directors. The audit committees responsibilities are governed by a written charter. The responsibilities of the audit committee include appointing our independent registered public accounting firm (subject to the shareholders approval under the Companies Law) and identifying irregularities in the management of our business in consultation with our independent accountants and the internal auditor and suggesting appropriate responses. The audit committees responsibilities also include approving related party transactions as required by the Companies Law. Neither the chairman of the board of directors, nor any director employed by or otherwise providing services on a regular basis to us, a controlling shareholder, or relative of a controlling shareholder may be a member of the audit committee. The audit committee may not approve an action or a transaction with a controlling shareholder, or with an office holder, unless at least two external directors are serving on the audit committee at the time of the approval, one of whom is present at the meeting at which the approval is granted. In addition, pursuant to the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market, we are required to maintain an audit committee including at least three independent directors. In accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our audit committee is required to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by our external auditors. The current members of our audit committee are Shlomo Toussia-Cohen, Ora Setter, Eliezer Manor, Raanan Ellran and Eli Akavia, all of which are independent directors. Eli Akavia is the Audit Committees Chairman, and our board has determined that he is an Audit Committee Financial Expert. Internal Auditor Under the Companies Law, the board of directors must appoint an internal auditor that is recommended by the audit committee. The role of the internal auditor is to examine, among other things, whether the companys actions comply with the law and orderly business procedure. Under the Companies Law, the internal auditor may not be an office holder or an interested party, as defined below, or a relative of an office holder or an interested party, and he or she may not be the companys independent accountant or the independent accountants representative. The Companies Law defines an interested party as a holder of 5% or more of the issued shares or voting rights of a company, a person or entity who has the right to designate at least one director or the general manager of the company, and a person who serves as a director or general manager. On January 1, 2008, our audit committee recommended the appointment of Mr. Gali Gana, CPA, from the office of Rosenblum Holzman & Co., as our internal auditor for the year 2008, and our board of directors approved the appointment. Fiduciary Duties; Approval of Certain Transactions The Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders owe to a company. An office holders fiduciary duties consist of a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires an office holder to act with the degree of care with which a reasonable office holder in the same position would act under the same circumstances. The duty of care includes using reasonable means to obtain information as to the advisability of a given action submitted for his or her approval or performed by virtue of his or her position, as well as all other information pertaining to such actions. 56 The duty of loyalty requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and includes avoiding any conflict of interest between the office holders other positions or personal affairs and the performance of his or her position in the company, avoiding any competition with the company, avoiding exploiting any business opportunity of the company in order to receive a personal benefit for himself or herself or others, and revealing to the company any information or documents relating to the companys affairs which come into the office holders possession as a result of his or her position as an office holder. The Companies Law further requires that an office holder discloses to the company any personal interest that he or she may have and all related material information known to him or her in connection with any existing or proposed transaction by the company. The disclosure must be made promptly and in no event later than the board of directors meeting at which the transaction is first discussed. In addition, if the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, as defined below, the office holder must also disclose any personal interest held by the office holders spouse, siblings, parents, grandparents, descendants, spouses descendants and the spouses of any of the foregoing and by any corporation in which the office holder is a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general manager or in which he or she has the right to appoint the general manager or at least one director. The Companies Law defines an extraordinary transaction as a transaction that is not in the ordinary course of business, that is not on market terms, or that is likely to have a material impact on a companys profitability, assets or liabilities. In the case of a transaction between the company and an office holder, or a third party in which an office holder has a personal interest, but that is not an extraordinary transaction and is not adverse to the companys interest, once the office holder complies with the above disclosure requirements only board approval is required, unless the articles of association of the company provide otherwise. In the case of an extraordinary transaction between the company and an office holder, or a third party in which an office holder has a personal interest, in addition to any approval required by the articles of association, the transaction must be approved first by the audit committee, then by the board of directors and, in certain cases, by the shareholders. A director who has a personal interest in a matter that is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee should in general not be present at this meeting or vote on this matter. If a majority of the directors have a personal interest in an extraordinary transaction, these directors are permitted to be present and vote on the transaction, but shareholder approval is also required. Under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(h), the Company should conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis and all such transactions should be approved by the companys audit committee or another independent body of the Board of Directors. Under the Companies Law, all arrangements as to compensation of office holders who are not directors require approval by the board of directors, and undertakings to indemnify or insure an office holder who is not a director require both board and audit committee approval. In general, arrangements regarding the compensation, indemnification and insurance of directors require audit committee and shareholder approval in addition to board approval. Under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(3)(A), compensation of the Chief Executive Officer must be determined, or recommended to the Board for determination, either by: (i) a majority of the independent directors, or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. The Chief Executive Officer may not be present during voting or deliberations. Under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4350(c)(3)(B) compensation of all executive officers, except the Chief Executive Officer, must be determined, or recommended to the Board for determination, either by (i) a majority of the independent directors, or (ii) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. The Companies Law applies the same disclosure requirements to a controlling party of a public company that it applies, as described above, to an office holder. For these purposes a controlling party is any person possessing the ability to direct the activities of the company, including a shareholder which holds 25% or more of the voting rights of the company if no other shareholder owns more than 50% of the voting rights in the company, but excluding a person whose power is derived solely from his or her position on the board of directors or from another position with the company. Two or more shareholders with a personal interest in the approval of the same transaction are deemed to be joint shareholders. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling party or in which a controlling party has a personal interest, a private placement in which the controlling party has a personal interest and the engagement and terms of compensation of a controlling party or his family members, require the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders. Shareholders approval must be by a majority of shares voted at the meeting, including at least one-third of the shares of the disinterested shareholders who are present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting, or, alternatively, the total shareholdings of the disinterested shareholders who vote against the transaction must not represent more than 1% of the aggregate voting rights in the company. 57 Under the Companies Law, a shareholder has a duty to refrain from abusing his or her power in the company and to act in good faith in exercising its rights and performing its obligations to the company and other shareholders, including, among other things, voting at a general meeting of shareholders on the following matters:  an amendment to the articles of association;  an increase in the company's authorized share capital;  a merger; and  approval of a related-party transaction requiring shareholder approval. In addition, any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who knows that his vote can determine the outcome of a shareholder vote and any shareholder who, under a companys articles of association, can appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder, is under a duty to act with fairness towards the company. The Companies Law does not describe the substance of this duty. D. EMPLOYEES The breakdown of the number of our employees, including employees in our subsidiaries, by department, is as follows: Number of employees as of December 31 Department 2006 2007 2008 Sales and marketing 39 41 41 Research and development 103 120 115 Manufacturing and operations 301 373 322 Customer support 20 22 23 Management and administration 125 126 124 Total 588 682 625 The decrease in the number of our employees in 2008 compared to 2007 was mainly in manufacturing and operation in the Far East and in research and development. Of our employees, on December 31, 2008, 121 were based in Israel, 10 in the United States, 105 in Europe, 34 in South Africa and 355 in the Far East. Under applicable law and by order of the Israeli Ministry of Labor and Welfare, we and our Israeli employees are subject to certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut, the General Federation of Labor in Israel and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations, including the Industrialists Association. These provisions principally concern cost of living increases, length of the working day, minimum daily wages for professional employees, contributions to pension funds, insurance for work-related accidents, procedures for dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual and other vacation, sick pay and other conditions of employment. We provide our employees with benefits and working conditions above the required minimum and which we believe are competitive with benefits and working conditions provided by similar companies in Israel. Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We have written employment agreements with substantially all of our employees. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense and it may be difficult to attract or maintain qualified personnel to our offices. We dedicate significant resources to employee retention and have never experienced work stoppages and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. E. SHARE OWNERSHIP The following table sets forth certain information as of June 23, 2009 regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares by each of our directors and executive officers. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. All information with respect to the beneficial ownership of any of the below shareholders has been furnished by such shareholder and, unless otherwise indicated below, we believe that persons named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all of the shares shown as beneficially owned, subject to community property laws, where applicable. The shares beneficially owned by the directors and executive officers include the shares owned by their family members to which such directors and executive officers disclaim beneficial ownership. 58 The share numbers and percentages listed below are based on 22,860,102 shares outstanding as of June 23, 2009: Name of beneficial owner(1) Number of Shares Beneficially Owned (2) % of Class of Shares Number of Options Beneficially Owned (3) Exercise Price Date of Expiration Oded Bashan(4) 2,417,509 10.6% Ronnie Gilboa(5) 241,089 1.0% 2,000 USD 32.00 March 1,2011 2,000 USD 9.00 March 1,2011 10,000 NIS 0.10 March 7,2012 15,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 Guy Shafran(6) 236,003 1.0% 574 NIS 0.10 May 14,2012 841 NIS 0.10 November 26, 2009 34,000 NIS 0.10 March 7,2012 75,000 USD 2.48 May 26, 2013 75,000 NIS 0.10 May 26, 2013 17,000 NIS 0.10 June 25, 2013 Tanir Horn(7) 32,469 *** 20,000 NIS 0.10 May 24, 2014 Moshe Aduk(8) 223,411 1.0% 662 NIS 0.10 May 14,2012 1,014 NIS 0.10 November 26, 2009 10,000 NIS 0.10 March 7,2012 15,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 Nehemya Itay(9) 233,883 1.0% 675 NIS 0.10 May 14,2012 1,064 NIS 0.10 November 26, 2009 5,000 NIS 0.10 August 17,2011 10,000 NIS 0.10 March 7,2012 12,000 NIS 0.10 December 3, 2007 Ohad Bashan 237,268 1.0% Shlomo Tussia-Cohen(10) 70,000 *** 40,000 $11.23 September 22, 2010 30,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 50,000 $11.23 September 22, 2010 Eliezer Manor(11) 80,000 *** 30,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 Ora Setter(12) 30,000 *** 30,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 Eli Akavia(13) 50,000 *** 50,000 $11.23 September 22, 2010 1,200 $42.50 March 11, 2011 Raanan Ellran(14) 31,200 *** 30,000 NIS 0.10 April 13,2012 All executive officers and directors as a group 3,882,832 16.6 % *** Less than 1% 59 (1) The number of ordinary shares shown includes shares that each shareholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after June 23, 2009 (as determined in accordance with footnote (3)).

In addition to the discussion below, please see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. Under Israeli law, except for issuances of options to directors, or members of their families, adoption of share option plans and revisions to these plans are not subject to shareholder approval. Under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, however, absent an exemption, most new share option plans and material revisions are subject to shareholders approval. 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2008, the Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which 1,500,000 of our ordinary shares have been reserved for eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The purchase price of the ordinary shares is 85% of the closing price on certain dates specified in the plan. As of June 23, 2009, an aggregate of 1,009,213 of our ordinary shares have been issued to eligible employees under this plan. In accordance with the decision of our board of directors, the implementation of this plan has been suspended with respect to the offering period of April-June 2009. 2006 Alternative Option Exercise Mechanism On April 11, 2006, we offered to each of our and our subsidiaries employees, and its directors and office holders (other than External Directors, as such term is defined in the Israeli Companies Law of 1999) who held outstanding vested and unvested options to purchase an aggregate of 4,485,017 of our ordinary shares, which were issued pursuant to the terms of the our 2001 Share Option Plan, as amended, to replace all of their outstanding vested and unvested options into a new number of ordinary shares, with the same fair values, as determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model, and the same vesting schedules. Our Board of Directors approved the Alternative Option Exercise Mechanism (AOEM), on February 12, 2006. Further, our shareholders approved the AOEM at an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders on March 21, 2006. As a result of the AOEM, we issued a total of 2,437,075 ordinary shares in exchange for options to acquire a total of 3,737,369 ordinary shares. A holder of options who did not participate in the AOEM, the original terms of his or her option agreement and the Share Option Plan continued to apply and such options are exercisable in accordance with their terms. In accordance with SFAS 123 R we consider the AOEM as a short-term inducement. Since the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares newly issued to each employee equals the fair value of the options replaced from him/her, no incremental compensation cost was recognized pursuant to the AOEM. 60 2001 Share Option Plan We established our 2001 Share Option Plan in February 2001. The plan provides for the grant of options to our employees, directors and consultants, and those of our subsidiaries and affiliates. Upon establishment of the plan, we reserved 75,000 ordinary shares for issuance. On February 26, 2002, on July 12, 2002, on March 28, 2003, on July 16, 2003, on September 2, 2003, on November 17, 2003, on April 20, 2004, on March 25, 2005, on September 25, 2005, and on December 3, 2007 our board of directors adopted certain resolutions with regard to the 2001 Share Option Plan that increased the number of available options under the plan by a total of 11,175,000 so that the aggregate number of options available under the plan is now 11,250,000. Under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, the increase of the number of available options under the plan pursuant to the board of directors resolutions dated March 28, 2003, July 16, 2003 and September 2, 2003 were subject to either our shareholders approval or an exemption granted that such approval is not required. We applied for an exemption in connection with such increases approved by the board of directors and such exemption has been granted by NASDAQ due to differences between the Israeli law and NASDAQ rules. On November 17, 2003, our board of directors approved a further increase of 500,000 options subject to either shareholders approval or additional exemption from NASDAQ. On April 20, 2004, our board of directors approved a further increase of 2,500,000 options subject to either shareholders approval or additional exemption from NASDAQ. On March 25, 2005, our board of directors approved a further increase of 2,500,000 options subject to either shareholders approval or additional exemption from NASDAQ. On September 25, 2005, our board of directors approved a further increase of 2,000,000 options. On December 3, 2007, our board of directors approved a further increase of 1,500,000 options. Currently, in accordance with Israeli law, increasing the shares pool in an option plan does not require shareholders approval. Under this plan, as of June 23, 2009, 6,338,529 options had been exercised and 1,710,936 options are outstanding and exercisable. Of the options that are outstanding, as of June 23, 2009, 657,029 options are held by our directors and officers listed above under Item 6.A Directors and Senior Management, and have a weighted average exercise price of $2.99. Our 2001 Share Option Plan is administered by our compensation committee which makes recommendations to our board of directors regarding the grantees of options and the terms of the grant, including exercise prices, grant dates, vesting schedules, acceleration of vesting and forfeiture. Under the Companies Law the allocation of options is solely within the authority of our board of directors. Under the plan, the terms and conditions of options are set forth in individual option agreements with the grantee. Under the plan, if the employment of a grantee is terminated for cause, all of his or her options expire immediately. A grantee whose employment is terminated without cause may exercise his or her vested options within three months of termination. If the termination is due to the death or disability of the grantee, the options may be exercised within 18 months of the date of termination in the case of death and 12 months in the case of disability. In accordance with the terms and conditions imposed by Section 102 of the Israel Income Tax Ordinance, or the Ordinance, grantees subject to taxation by the State of Israel that receive options under the 2001 Share Option Plan (excluding grantees who previously received options that were incorporated upon the commencement of Amendment No. 132 of the Income Tax ordinance, or the Tax Reform, that was approved on July 24, 2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003, and those who are not employees or office holders and those who are our controlling shareholders) are afforded certain tax benefits. We elected the benefits available under the capital gains alternative. There are various conditions that must be met in order to qualify for these benefits, including registration of the options in the name of a trustee, or the Trustee, for each of the Israeli employees who is granted options. Each such option, and any ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of such option, must be held by the Trustee for a period commencing on the date of grant and ending no earlier than 24 months as of the end of the date in which the option was granted and deposited in trust with the Trustee or as of the end of such tax year (based on the time of grant). In the capital gains alternative a company may not recognize expenses pertaining to the options for tax purposes. We also granted our Israeli employees options pursuant to Section 102(c) of the Ordinance that are not held in trust by a trustee, which while enabling the immediate exercising and selling of options granted under the 2001 Share Option Plan, will be subject to the marginal tax rate up to 50% plus payments to the National Insurance Institute and health tax on the date of the sale of the shares or options. As of January 1, 2003, Section 3(i) of the Ordinance was partially replaced by Section 102(c) and no longer applies to allocations of options to Israeli employees (including directors and office holders). Section 3(i) still applies and imposes taxes on individuals and entities subject to taxation in Israel who are not employees (such as consultants and service providers) and to employees who are considered controlling shareholders. 61 2001 Employee Share Purchase Plan In June 2001, we approved the establishment of an employee share purchase plan. No shares have been issued under the plan. Under the plan, we have reserved 67,500 ordinary shares for purchase by our employees and those of our subsidiaries who have been employed for at least six months. Eligible employees may purchase our ordinary shares at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our ordinary shares of the first day of the applicable offering period or the first day of the applicable offering period. On March 22, 2009 our board of directors resolved to terminate this plan. ITEM 7. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS A.

Record Holders Based on a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of June 23, 2009, there were 79 holders of record of our ordinary shares, of which 21 record holders holding approximately 1% of our ordinary shares had registered addresses in the United States. These numbers are not representative of the number of beneficial holders of our shares nor is it representative of where such beneficial holders reside since many of these ordinary shares were held of record by brokers or other nominees (including one U.S. nominee company, CEDE & Co., which held approximately 90% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of said date). B. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our policy is to enter into transactions with related parties on terms that are on the whole no less favorable to us than those that would be available from unaffiliated parties. Based on our experience in the business sectors in which we operate and the terms of our transactions with unaffiliated third parties, we believe that all of the transactions described below met this policy standard at the time they occurred. Agreement with HolyTech Ltd. In January 1996, we entered into an agreement with HolyTech Ltd., a company owned by Varda Bashan, Ora Gilboa and certain other of our shareholders, which formalized an arrangement that had existed since 1992. Varda Bashan is the spouse of Oded Bashan, our co-founder and chairman of our board of directors, and Ora Gilboa is the spouse of Ronnie Gilboa, our co-founder and a director. Under the agreement, HolyTech provides us with management and engineering services as needed. Mrs. Bashan provides administration services and a number of other shareholders of HolyTech, who are also our employees, provide engineering and warehouse services. HolyTech has no activities other than the provision of these services to us. The cost of these services is intended to equal the cost of these services if performed by unrelated parties. The aggregate consideration for the services that HolyTech provided to us was $68,000 in 2006 , $73,000 in 2007 and $109,000 in 2008. Agreements with Directors and Officers We have entered into employment agreements with all of our officers. In addition, we have granted options to purchase our ordinary shares to our officers and directors. On January 31, 2003 the shareholders of OTI approved a bonus plan for our senior management and on July 11, 2003 our general meeting of shareholders approved a plan to issue options to our non-executive directors. See also Item 6.B. under Executive Compensation. Agreement Relating to Insurance Services We have been receiving insurance agency services from a family member of one of our officers. On August 22, 2003, our board of directors ratified and approved such engagement in accordance with the applicable Israeli Companies Law provisions. 63 C. INTERESTS OF EXPERTS AND COUNSEL Not applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION A. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION The financial statements required by this item are found in Item 18 of this annual report, beginning on page F-1. Legal Proceedings We or our subsidiaries are a named defendant in the following litigations: On May 20, 2008 a plaintiff filed a complaint against us and one of our subsidiaries, in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of two US patents and requesting a declaration that we infringe these patents, and therefore asking for an injunction, damages and attorneys fees. We filed our response on July 25, 2008, denying infringement and identifying certain defenses. Further, we brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff for infringement of a U.S. patent of us, seeking a declaration that the plaintiff is infringing our patent, and therefore asking for an injunction, damages and attorneys fees. At this stage, based on legal advice, we are unable to estimate the chances of the claim and, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of this claim. On September 3, 2003, Edi Wuhl, a former employee of us, filed a suit against us in the District Labor Court in Nazareth in the amount of NIS 3,953,000 (approximately $1,040,000) claiming that we breached the employment agreement with him, and that we owe him commission payment for certain sales. On January 10, 2008, the district court resolved that Mr. Wuhl is entitled to approximately $60,000, and therefore, during 2008 the Company paid this amount and recorded it in the financial statements. On April 28, 2008 the plaintiff submitted an appeal to the National Labor Court in Jerusalem. A hearing in the appeal was conducted in June 2009. At this stage, based on legal advice, we are unable to estimate the chances of the appeal and, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of the appeal. In September 2007, a plaintiff filed against one of our subsidiaries, a motion to approve a class action at the Tel Aviv District Court, at the sum of NIS 67.1 million ($17.6 million). The law suit was based on claims regarding the performance of certain device product of the subsidiary. Based on the courts recommendation at the preliminary hearing, on January 21, 2009 the plaintiff had filed an application to remove the motion, and the court had accepted this application and the motion was removed. In October 2007, a plaintiff filed against one of our subsidiaries, and other third parties a motion to approve a class action at the Tel Aviv District Court, at the sum of approximately NIS 2 million ($526,000). According to the plaintiff, the subsidiary and the other defendants charged via the subsidiarys product, an amount per hour which exceeds the amount that they are authorize to charge. On January 15, 2008, our subsidiary submitted to court a notice in which it joins to the other defendants application to dismiss the motion. On a preliminary hearing conducted on September 14, 2008, the court accepted such defendants arguments that the motion should be dismissed. In addition, the court instructed the parties to submit their summaries only with respect to the consideration to be paid to the plaintiff and his legal counsel. At this stage, based on legal advice, we are unable to estimate the chances of the motion and, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of this motion. On June 16, 2008, a plaintiff (Plaintiff) filed a patent infringement suit in Shenzhen Intermediate Court, Shenzhen, China (Lawsuit), alleging that one of our subsidiaries infringes a Chinese patent assigned to the Plaintiff (Patent). The Plaintiff requested an injunction, a relief of RMB 1 million (approximately $146,000) for its damages, the expenses incurred by it in relation to the efforts to cease the infringement and all court fees of the case. On May 5, 2009, the Shenzhen Intermediate Court stayed the Lawsuit until a litigation between the Plaintiff and a third party relating to the assignment of the Patent rights pending in the Beijing 1st Intermediate Court is resolved. At this stage, based on legal advice, we are unable to estimate the chances of the Lawsuit and, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements in respect of the Lawsuit. 64 Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares or other securities. We currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the development of our business, and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and future prospects and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant. In the event of a distribution of a cash dividend out of tax exempt income, we will be liable for corporate tax at a rate of 25% in respect of the amount distributed. Though we never declared or paid a cash dividend, in November 2008 our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our shares in a total aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million conditioned approval by court, as required under Israeli law. In May 2009 the court approved a repurchase program in a total amount of up to $2 million. B.
