ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely in the future. Our common stock, which is traded on The New York Stock Exchange, has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results, earnings below analysts estimates and financial performance and other activities of other publicly traded companies in the semiconductor industry could cause the price of our common stock to 13 Table of Contents fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent periods, our common stock, the stock market in general and the market for shares of semiconductor industry-related stocks in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Any similar fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation, reduction or delay in delivery schedules, which may result in lower than expected revenues. We manufacture products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast, rather than pursuant to long-term supply contracts. The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in customer outlooks or unexpected build ups of inventory in the supply channel as a result of shifts in end market demand. Accordingly, many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty. As a result, we must commit resources to the production of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers. Even in cases where our standard terms and conditions of sale or other contractual arrangements do not permit a customer to cancel an order without penalty, we may from time to time accept cancellations because of industry practice or custom or other factors. Our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on both our levels of inventory and revenues. Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end user market demands could reduce the profitability and overall value of our business, which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have other adverse effects on our financial position. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and the value of our business may decline during the down portion of these cycles. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into 2003, we and the rest of the semiconductor industry experienced backlog cancellations and reduced demand for our products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at computer and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. Although we believe the low point of this most recent cycle occurred in the third quarter of 2001, the semiconductor industry did not experience a recovery in orders until 2003. We may experience renewed, possibly more severe and prolonged, downturns in the future as a result of such cyclical changes. Even as demand increases following such downturns, our profitability may not increase because of price competition that historically accompanies recoveries in demand. For example, in 2002, we sold approximately 7% more units than in 2001, yet our revenues were essentially unchanged. And, in 2003 we sold approximately the same number of units as in 2002, while at the same time experiencing revenue declines due to price decreases. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products, and our efforts to reduce excess inventories that may have built up as a result of any of these factors. The markets for our products depend on continued demand for consumer electronics such as personal computers, cellular telephones, and digital cameras, and automotive, household and industrial goods. These end user markets may experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our prospects. We may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changing demands from customers. Our failure to develop new technologies, or react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. New products often command higher prices and, as a result, higher profit margins. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market or succeed in selling them into new customer applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 14 Table of Contents Many of our competitors are larger, older and well established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. A fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets that we fail to identify correctly or adequately, or that we fail to capitalize on, in each case relative to our competitors, could have material adverse effects on our competitive position within the industry. In addition, to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce die sizes, develop new packages and improve manufacturing yields. We cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals. If some original equipment manufacturers do not design our products into their equipment, our revenue may be adversely affected. The success of our products often depends on whether original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), or their contract manufacturers, choose to incorporate or design in our products, or identify our products, with those from a limited number of other vendors, as approved for use in particular OEM applications. Even receiving design wins from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer. We may be unable to achieve these design wins due to competition over the subject products functionality, size, electrical characteristics or other aspect of its design, price, or due to our inability to service expected demand from the customer or other factors. Without design wins, we would only be able to sell our products to customers as a second source, if at all. If an OEM designs another suppliers product into one of its applications, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that application because, for the customer, changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk. In addition, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenue from that customer and we may be unable to convert design into actual sales. We depend on demand from the consumer, original equipment manufacturer, contract manufacturing, industrial, automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications which incorporate our products. Reduced consumer or corporate spending due to increased oil prices or other economic factors could affect our revenues. Our revenue and gross margin guidance are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending. If our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize, due to reduced consumer or corporate spending from increased oil prices or otherwise, our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, and we cannot assure you that:  the patents owned by us or numerous other patents which third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies; or  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. We also seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such research. Some of our technologies have been licensed on a non-exclusive basis from National Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and other companies which may license 15 Table of Contents such technologies to others, including our competitors. In addition, under a technology licensing and transfer agreement, National Semiconductor has limited royalty-free, worldwide license rights (without right to sublicense) to some of our technologies. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under patents or intellectual property rights claimed by others. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies. Our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use some technologies may negatively affect our financial results. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain proprietary technologies used in our principal products, which is achieved in part by defending claims by competitors and others of intellectual property infringement. The semiconductor industry is characterized by claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may be notified of claims (often implicit in offers to sell us a license to another companys patents) that we may be infringing patents issued to other companies, and we may subsequently engage in license negotiations regarding these claims. Such claims relate both to products and manufacturing processes. Even though we maintain procedures to avoid infringing others rights as part of our product and process development efforts, it is impossible to be aware of every possible patent which our products may infringe, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful. Furthermore, even if we conclude our products do not infringe anothers patents, others may not agree. We have been and are involved in lawsuits, and could become subject to other lawsuits, in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of other companies. For example, since October 2004, we have been in litigation with Power Integrations, Inc. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Our involvement in this lawsuit and future intellectual property litigation, or the costs of avoiding or settling litigation by purchasing licenses rights or by other means, could result in significant expense to our company, adversely affecting sales of the challenged products or technologies and diverting the efforts and attention of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. We may decide to settle patent infringement claims or litigation by purchasing license rights from the claimant, even if we believe we are not infringing, in order to reduce the expense of continuing the dispute or because we are not sufficiently confident that we would eventually prevail. In the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may be required to:  pay substantial damages;  indemnify our customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us violate the intellectual property rights of others;  stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;  discontinue manufacturing processes; or  obtain licenses to the intellectual property we are found to have infringed. We cannot assure you that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business. We have made twelve acquisitions of various sizes since we became an independent company in 1997, and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses. We are also in the process of acquiring Taipei- based System General Corporation, a leading supplier of analog power management semiconductors for AC/DC 16 Table of Contents offline power conversion in computers, LCD monitors, printers, chargers, and consumer products. The transaction is structured as a tender offer by one of our subsidiaries for all outstanding shares of System General followed by a share swap and merger. We launched the tender offer on January 2, 2007, in Taiwan and the tender offer period closed on January 31, 2007 with 95.6% of the shares tendered. We expect to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of 2007. The costs of acquiring and integrating related businesses, or our failure to integrate them successfully into our existing businesses, could result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. In addition, we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete. We are constantly pursuing acquisition opportunities and consolidation possibilities and are frequently conducting due diligence or holding preliminary discussions with respect to possible acquisition transactions, some of which could be significant. No material potential acquisition transactions are subject to a letter of intent or otherwise so far advanced as to make the transaction reasonably certain, other than the System General transaction discussed above. If we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with acquisitions include:  unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired company;  conforming the acquired companys standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;  coordinating new product and process development;  hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  negotiating with labor unions; and  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of other businesses we acquire. Possible future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We depend on suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials of acceptable quality. Production time and product costs could increase if we were to lose a primary supplier or if a primary supplier increased the prices of raw materials. Product performance could be affected and quality issues could develop as a result of a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials we use in our products. Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly. Results could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. For example, some phosphorus-containing mold compound received from one supplier and incorporated into our products has resulted in a number of claims for damages from customers. We purchase raw materials such as silicon wafers, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and chemicals and gases from a limited number of suppliers on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. We subcontract a minority of our wafer fabrication needs, primarily to 17 Table of Contents Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Phenitec Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Central Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, UMC, WIN Semiconductor, Jilin Magic Semiconductor, More Power Electric Corporation and New Japan Radio Corporation. In order to maximize our production capacity, some of our back-end assembly and testing operations are also subcontracted. Primary back-end subcontractors include Amkor, AUK, Enoch, SP Semiconductor, UTAC Thai Ltd., Liteon, GEM Services and STATS ChipPAC. Our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated. Delays in beginning production at new facilities, expanding capacity at existing facilities, implementing new production techniques, or incurring problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions, all could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies. Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. In 2003, we began initial production at a new assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China. We are transferring some production from subcontractors to this new facility. Delays or technical problems in completing these transfers could lead to order cancellations and lost revenue. In addition, we are currently engaged in an effort to expand capacity at some of our manufacturing facilities. As is common in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in completing transitions to new manufacturing processes at existing facilities. As a consequence, we have suffered delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. We may experience delays or problems in bringing our new factory in Suzhou, China or other new manufacturing capacity to full production. Such delays, as well as possible problems in achieving acceptable yields, or product delivery delays relating to existing or planned new capacity could result from, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. Approximately two-thirds of our sales are made to distributors who can terminate their relationships with us with little or no notice. The termination of a distributor could reduce sales and result in inventory returns. Distributors accounted for 67% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our top five distributors worldwide accounted for 19% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. As a general rule, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, and they may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. Distributors generally offer competing products. The loss of one or more of our distributors, or the decision by one or more of them to reduce the number of our products they offer or to carry the product lines of our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of a significant distributor, whether at our or the distributors initiative, or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors, could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns. The semiconductor business is very competitive, especially in the markets we serve, and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company. The semiconductor industry is, and the standard component or multi-market semiconductor product markets in particular are, highly competitive. Competitors offer equivalent or similar versions of many of our 18 Table of Contents products, and customers may switch from our products to competitors products on the basis of price, delivery terms, product performance, quality, reliability and customer service or a combination of any of these factors. Competition is especially intense in the multi-market semiconductor segment because it is relatively easier for customers to switch suppliers of more standardized, multi-market products like ours, compared to switching suppliers of more highly integrated or customized semiconductor products such as processors or system-on-a-chip products, which we do not manufacture. Even in strong markets, price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have and thus are better able to pursue acquisition candidates and can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. We may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry. Our continued success depends on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees, is intense, particularly in the up portions of our business cycle, when competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. If we must reduce our use of stock options and other equity awards, our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected. Our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates and judgments we use to value our stock-based compensation. Like most technology companies, we have a history of using broad-based employee stock option programs to recruit and retain our workforce in a competitive employment marketplace. Although we have reduced our use of traditional stock options in the past several years in favor of deferred stock units, restricted stock units and performance-based equity awards, we still use stock options and expect to continue to use them as one component of our stock-based compensation program. As a result, our success will depend in part upon the continued use of stock options as a compensation tool. We plan to seek stockholder approval for increases in the number of shares available for grant under the Fairchild Semiconductor Stock Plan as well as other amendments that may be adopted from time to time which require stockholder approval. If these proposals do not receive stockholder approval, we may not be able to grant stock options and other equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past, which could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, and we may need to increase cash compensation in order to attract, retain and motivate employees, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), in the first quarter of 2006. This resulted in $0.11 lower reported earnings per diluted share for year ended December 31, 2006, which could negatively affect our future stock price. The impact of SFAS 123(R) could also negatively affect our ability to utilize broad-based employee stock plans to reward employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace. The calculation of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R) requires us to use valuation methodologies and a number of estimates, assumptions and conclusions regarding matters such as the expected volatility of our share price, the expected life of our options, the expected dividend rate with respect to our common stock, expected forfeitures and the exercise behavior of our employees. See the Stock-Based Compensation Expense section of Item 8 of this report for further information. There are no means, under applicable accounting principles, to compare and adjust this expense if and when we learn of additional information that may affect the estimates that we previously made, with the exception of changes in expected 19 Table of Contents forfeitures of stock-based awards. Certain factors may arise over time that lead us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future stock-based compensation, resulting in variability in our stock-based compensation expense over time. Changes in forecasted stock-based compensation expense could impact our gross margin percentage, research and development expenses, marketing, general and administrative expenses and our tax rate. We may face product warranty or product liability claims that are disproportionately higher than the value of the products involved. Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer may be sold for several dollars, whereas the personal computer might be sold by the computer maker for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we manufacture and sell approximately 16 billion individual semiconductor devices per year to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some of these products that are defective or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. We attempt, through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts, to limit our liability by agreeing only to replace the defective goods or refund the purchase price. Nevertheless, we have received claims for other charges, such as for labor and other costs of replacing defective parts or repairing the products into which the defective products are incorporated, lost profits and other damages. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities, whether by contracts or otherwise, may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. And, even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customers business or goodwill or to settle claims to avoid protracted litigation. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. For example, from time to time since late 2001, we have received claims from a number of customers seeking damages resulting from certain products manufactured with a phosphorus-containing mold compound. Mold compound is the plastic resin used to encapsulate semiconductor chips. This particular mold compound causes some chips to short in some situations, resulting in chip failure. We have been named in lawsuits relating to these mold compound claims. In January 2005, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Lucent Technologies Inc. in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The Lucent lawsuit alleges breach of contract and breach of warranty claims and seeks unspecified damages allegedly caused by our products. Lucent amended the lawsuit in the second quarter of 2006 to include a fraud claim against us. We believe we have strong defenses against Lucents claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. On January 5, 2007, White Rock Networks sued us and two distributors, Arrow Electronics and All American Semiconductor, in the Eastern District of Texas, for violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) relating to the mold compound issue, claiming unspecified damages. We have not yet been served in the case. We believe we have strong defenses against White Rock Networks claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit if it is served on us. Several other customers have made claims for damages or threatened to begin litigation as a result of the mold compound issue if their claims are not resolved according to their demands, and we may face additional lawsuits as a result. We have resolved similar claims with several of our leading customers. We have exhausted insurance coverage for such customer claims. While the exact amount of these losses is not known, we recorded a reserve for estimated potential settlement losses of $11.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the second quarter of 2004 and $6.9 million the fourth quarter of 2005. These estimates were based upon assessments of the potential liability using an analysis of the claims and historical experience. At December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, the reserve for estimated potential settlement losses was $5.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively. If we continue to receive additional claims for damages from customers beyond the period 20 Table of Contents of time normally observed for such claims, if more of these claims proceed to litigation, or if we choose to settle claims in settlement of or to avoid litigation, then we may incur a liability in excess of the current reserve. In a related action, we filed a lawsuit in August 2002 against the mold compound supplier, Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. and other related parties in California Superior Court for Santa Clara County, alleging claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence and other claims and seeking unspecified damages, including damages caused to our customers as a result of mold compound supplied by Sumitomo. Other manufacturers also filed lawsuits against Sumitomo relating to the same mold compound issue. On September 30, 2005, we agreed to settle the lawsuit against Sumitomo. We previously agreed to settle litigation against Amkor Technology, Inc., a co-defendant with Sumitomo. Our international operations subject our company to risks not faced by domestic competitors. Through our subsidiaries we maintain significant operations and facilities in the Philippines, Malaysia, China, South Korea and Singapore. We have sales offices and customers around the world. Approximately 75% of our revenues in fiscal year 2006 were from Asia. The following are some of the risks inherent in doing business on an international level:  economic and political instability;  foreign currency fluctuations;  transportation delays;  trade restrictions;  changes in laws and regulations relating to, amongst other things, import and export tariffs, taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights and property,  work stoppages; and  the laws of, including tax laws, and the policies of the United States toward, countries in which we manufacture our products. We acquired significant operations and revenues when we acquired a business from Samsung Electronics and, as a result, are subject to risks inherent in doing business in Korea, including political risk, labor risk and currency risk. As a result of the acquisition of the power device business from Samsung Electronics in 1999, we have significant operations and sales in South Korea and are subject to risks associated with doing business there. Korea accounted for 15% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006. Relations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense over most of South Koreas history, and more recent concerns over North Koreas nuclear capability, and relations between the United States and North Korea, have created a global security issue that may adversely affect Korean business and economic conditions. We cannot assure you as to whether or when this situation will be resolved or change abruptly as a result of current or future events. An adverse change in economic or political conditions in South Korea or in its relations with North Korea could have a material adverse effect on our Korean subsidiary and our company. In addition to other risks disclosed relating to international operations, some businesses in South Korea are subject to labor unrest. Our Korean sales are increasingly denominated primarily in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our Korean operations costs of goods sold and operating expenses are denominated in South Korean won. Although we have taken steps to fix the costs subject to currency fluctuations and to balance won revenues and won costs as much as possible, a significant change in this balance, coupled with a significant change in the value of the won relative to the dollar, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations (see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk). 21 Table of Contents A change in foreign tax laws or a difference in the construction of current foreign tax laws by relevant foreign authorities could result in us not recognizing the benefits we anticipated in connection with the transaction structure used to consummate the acquisition of the power device business. The transaction structure we used for the acquisition of the power device business is based on assumptions about the various tax laws, including income and withholding tax, and other relevant laws of foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our Korean subsidiary was granted a ten-year tax holiday under Korean law in 1999. The first seven years are tax-free, followed by three years of income taxes at 50% of the statutory rate. In 2000, the tax holiday was extended such that the exemption amounts were increased to 78% in the eighth year and a 28% exemption was added to the eleventh year. If our assumptions about tax and other relevant laws are incorrect, or if foreign taxing jurisdictions were to change or modify the relevant laws, or if our Korean subsidiary were to lose its tax holiday, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or lose the benefits anticipated from the transaction structure we used to acquire that business. We have significantly expanded our manufacturing operations in China and, as a result, will be increasingly subject to risks inherent in doing business in China, which may adversely affect our financial performance. In 2003, we completed the first phase of construction of an 800,000 square foot assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China, and in 2004 began implementing the second phase. The factory began production in July 2003 and is steadily increasing its output. Although we expect a significant portion of our production from this new facility will be exported out of China, especially initially, we are hopeful that a significant portion of our future revenue will result from the Chinese markets in which our products are sold, and from demand in China for goods that include our products. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in that countrys laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations in China are subject to the economic and political situation there. We believe that our operations in China are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that Chinas central or local governments will not impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures. Changes in the political environment or government policies could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between China and the United States could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products in China. The legal system of China relating to foreign trade is relatively new and continues to evolve. There can be no certainty as to the application of its laws and regulations in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses. Increasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of pollutants that can be released from our operations into the environment. While the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with these and any future regulations could require significant capital investments in pollution control equipment or changes in the way we make our products. In addition, because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes, we are subject to risks of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, resulting from our use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines, any of which could be material to our cash flow or earnings. For example:  we currently are remediating contamination at some of our operating plant sites; 22 Table of Contents  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at a number of Superfund sites where we (or our predecessors) disposed of wastes in the past; and  significant regulatory and public attention on the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in more stringent regulations, further increasing our costs. Although most of our known environmental liabilities are covered by indemnification agreements with Raytheon Company, National Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and Intersil Corporation, these indemnities are limited to conditions that occurred prior to the consummation of the transactions through which we acquired facilities from those companies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that their indemnity obligations to us for the covered liabilities will be available, or, if available, adequate to protect us. We are a leveraged company with a ratio of debt to equity at December 31, 2006 of approximately 0.5 to 1, which could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to grow and compete. At December 31, 2006, we had total debt of $592.5 million and the ratio of this debt to equity was approximately 0.5 to 1. In January 2005, we increased the senior credit facility to $630 million, consisting of a term loan of $450 million replacing the previous $300 million term loan, and a $180 million revolving line of credit. The proceeds from the increased senior credit facility were used, together with approximately $216 million in cash, to redeem all our outstanding 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009. On June 22, 2006 we reduced the outstanding balance on the term loan by $50 million to $394 million. On June 26, 2006 we refinanced the existing senior credit facility consisting of a term loan of $375 million, replacing the previous $450 million term loan and replacing the previous $180 million revolving line of credit with a $100 million revolving line of credit, of which $79.4 million remained undrawn as of December 31, 2006, adjusted for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, there is a $200 million uncommitted incremental term loan feature. Despite reducing some of our long-term debt, we continue to carry substantial indebtedness which could have important consequences. For example, it could:  require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;  increase the amount of our interest expense, because certain of our borrowings (namely borrowings under our senior credit facility) are at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the instruments governing our indebtedness;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; or  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, repurchase stock or pay cash dividends. Failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 23 Table of Contents Despite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The indenture governing Fairchild Semiconductor Corporations outstanding 5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2008 does not limit the amount of additional debt that we may incur. Although the terms of the credit agreement relating to the senior credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions or upon further amendment of the credit facility could be substantial. The senior credit facility, from June 2006, permits borrowings of up to $100 million in revolving loans under the line of credit and up to $200 million under the uncommitted incremental term loan feature, in addition to the outstanding $375 million term loan that is currently outstanding under that facility. As of December 31, 2006, adjusted for outstanding letters of credit, we had up to $79.4 million available under the revolving loan portion of the senior credit facility. If new debt is added to our subsidiaries current debt levels, the substantial risks described above would intensify. We may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness, which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, because our senior credit facility has variable interest rates, the cost of those borrowings will increase if market interest rates increase. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Restrictions imposed by the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into some business operating and financing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of potentially profitable business opportunities. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility may limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests. The credit agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions that affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets, pay dividends, sell assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions, make investments or engage in other business activities. These restrictions could place us at a disadvantage relative to competitors not subject to such limitations. In addition, the senior credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with these ratios. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against our assets, including any collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under the senior credit facility accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
