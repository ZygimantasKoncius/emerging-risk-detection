We may terminate the employment for cause, at any time, without notice or remuneration, for certain acts of the employee, including but not limited to a conviction or plea of guilty to certain crimes, negligence or dishonesty to our detriment and failure to perform the agreed-to duties after a reasonable opportunity to cure the failure. An executive officer may terminate his employment at any time with one-month prior written notice if there is a material reduction in his authority, duties and responsibilities or if there is a material reduction in his annual salary before the next annual salary review. Furthermore, we may terminate the employment at any time without cause upon advance written notice to the executive officer. These agreements do not provide for any special termination benefits, nor do we have other arrangements with these executive officers for special termination benefits. 59 Table of Contents Each executive officer has agreed to hold, both during and after the employment agreement expires or is earlier terminated, in strict confidence and not to use, except as required in the performance of his duties in connection with the employment, any confidential information, trade secrets and know-how of our company or the confidential information of any third party, including our variable interest entities and our subsidiaries, received by us.

B. Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers Our directors and executive officers receive compensation in the form of annual salaries and bonuses. While we do not have a specific bonus plan setting the calculation of our annual bonuses, each director and executive officer is entitled to receive an annual discretionary bonus based upon his or her performance of such amount as shall be determined by the board of directors. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, the total compensation we paid to our executive officers and directors was approximately RMB20.5 million ($3.3 million), including share-based compensation in the amount of approximately RMB16.3 million ($2.6 million). See  Share Incentive Plans below for information regarding share options that we granted to our executive officers and directors. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, we paid RMB39,000 ($6,000) for pension, retirement or similar benefits for our executives officers and directors. Share Incentive Plans The board of directors of China Linong adopted share incentive plans in May 2007 and April 2009 and our board of directors adopted a share incentive plan in August 2010. These incentive plans were adopted to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to directors, officers, advisors and key employees and to promote the success of our business. Options to purchase 66.58 ordinary shares of China Linong under China Linongs 2007 share incentive plan were issued in 2007 and after a 1-to-1000 subdivision in 2008 and an option exchange in 2010, these options subsequently represented the right to purchase 66,580,000 of our ordinary shares. As part of our restructuring, we adopted a 2009 share incentive plan, or the 2009 plan, whose key provisions are substantially the same as those of China Linongs 2009 share incentive plan. We have reserved an aggregate of 151,430,000 ordinary shares for issuance under the 2009 plan. In July 2010, China Linong, we and all option grantees under China Linongs 2007 and 2009 share incentive plans entered into an option exchange agreement, under which the option grantees agreed to exchange their option shares granted by China Linong with options to purchase our shares under the same terms and conditions. In August 2010, our board of directors and shareholders adopted a 2010 share incentive plan, or the 2010 plan. The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards under the 2010 plan is 60,000,000 shares, plus an annual increase on the first day of each year, beginning in the year ending December 31, 2011 and ending in the year ending December 31, 2021, equal to the lesser of (1) 60,000,000 shares, (2) two percent of the shares outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (3) such smaller number of shares as determined by our board of directors. Our future option grants will be made pursuant to the 2010 plan. The following paragraphs describe the principal terms of our share incentive plans. Types of awards The types of awards we may grant under the plans include the options to purchase our ordinary shares at a specified price and in a specified period determined by our compensation committee. Under the 2010 plan, we may also grant awards of our ordinary (1) restricted shares, (2) restricted share units, (3) dividend equivalents, (4) deferred shares, (5) share payments and (6) share appreciation rights under the terms and conditions determined by our compensation committee. 60 Table of Contents Eligibility We may grant awards to directors, officers, advisors and employees of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiaries and any entity which may thereafter be established. Plan administration The compensation committee of our board of directors, or a committee of no less than two (or five, in the case of China Linongs 2007 plan and the 2009 plan) members of the board of directors, will administer the plans. The committee will determine the terms and conditions of each grant, including but not limited to, the exercise, grant or purchase prices, any reload provision, any restrictions or limitations on the awards, vesting schedules, restrictions on the exercisability of the awards, any accelerations or waivers, and any provision related to non-competition and recapture of gain on the awards. Option offer letter/Award agreement Awards granted under the plans will be evidenced by an option offer letter or an award agreement that will set forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. The option offer letter should be signed by the employee and a director or an officer of the Company. Share awards may be evidenced by way of an issuance of certificates or book entries with appropriate legends. The certificates and book entry procedures may be subject to counsels advice, stop-transfer orders or other conditions or restrictions where the plan administrator deems necessary to comply with the required laws and regulations. Vesting The 2010 plan provides that the administrator may set the period during which an option or a share appreciation right can be exercised and may determine that an option or a share appreciation right may not be exercised for a specified period after it is granted. Such vesting can be based on criteria selected by the administrator. At any time after the grant of an option or a share appreciation right, the administrator may, in its sole discretion and subject to terms and conditions it determines, accelerate the period during which an option or a share appreciation right vests. No portion of an option or a share appreciation right unexercisable at the termination of service of an option or a share appreciation right holder with our company or subsidiaries can become exercisable afterwards, unless otherwise provided by the administrator. The 2009 plan provides that the administrator may set the period during which an option can be exercised and may determine that an option may not be exercised for a specified period after it is granted. Such vesting can be based on criteria selected by the administrator. However, any option granted will vest immediately prior to any merger into, consolidation with or acquisition of our company by another company in which our companys shareholders do not retain more than 50% of the voting power. At any time after the grant of an option, the administrator may, in its sole discretion and subject to terms and conditions it determines, accelerate the period during which an option vests. No portion of an option unexercisable at the termination of service of an option holder with our company or its subsidiaries can become exercisable afterwards, unless otherwise provided by the administrator. China Linongs 2007 share incentive plan provides that the period during which each option may be vested should be fixed by the compensation committee at the time such option is granted, but the option will expire no later than 10 years from the date it is granted. Each option granted may be vested only after one year of continued employment by our company or its subsidiaries immediately following the date the option if granted. However, any option granted will vest immediately prior to any merger into, consolidation with or acquisition of our company by another company in which our companys shareholders do not retain more than 50% of the voting power. Exercise price and term of awards The exercise price per share of options granted under the 2010 plan is determined by the plan administrator in the award agreement. The price may be fixed or variable related to the fair market value of our ordinary shares. The term of any option granted should not exceed 10 years. However in the case where our incentive option is granted to an individual who, at the date of grant, owns more than ten percent of the total voting power of all classes of our shares, the price granted shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant and the option is exercisable for no more than five years from the date of grant. For ordinary share awards granted under the 2010 plan, namely (1) restricted shares, (2) restricted share units, (3) dividend equivalents, (4) deferred shares, and (5) share payments, the consideration shall not be less than the par value of the shares purchased. The terms of the share awards are set by the plan administrator in its sole discretion. 61 Table of Contents The exercise price of share appreciation right under the 2010 plan is determined by the plan administrator and set forth in the award agreement which may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of the shares. The term of the share appreciation right will not exceed 10 years. The exercise price per share of options granted under the 2009 plan is determined by the plan administrator in the award agreement. The price may be fixed or variable related to the fair market value of our ordinary shares. The fair market value is the value of shares determined in good faith by reference to the placing price of the latest private placement of the shares and the development of our business operations and the general economic and market conditions since such latest private placement. The term of any option granted will not exceed 10 years. Under China Linongs 2007 share incentive plan, the exercise price of an award is generally determined by the compensation committee but the price should be no less than 100% of the fair market value of such shares of ordinary shares on the date the option is granted. However, the fair market value as determined should not be less than the book value of our ordinary shares as reflected in our most recent audited financial statements. The fair market value of shares should be deemed conclusive upon the determination of the compensation committee in good faith. The term of an award should not exceed 10 years from the date of the grant. Transfer restrictions The awards granted under the 2010 plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the plan administrator, as required under the applicable laws. Under the 2009 plan, the plan administrator has the power to determine the restrictions on the exercisability of the award granted, based on considerations determined by the plan administrator. Under China Linongs 2007 share incentive plan, an option granted may not be transferred except by will or the laws of descent or distribution, and during the lifetime of the employee to whom the option is granted, may be exercised only by such employee. Amendments or termination The 2009 plan and the 2010 plan provide that in the event of any changes affecting our ordinary shares or our share price, the plan administrator can make proportionate and equitable adjustments to reflect such changes. Upon or in anticipation of a corporate transaction, including acquisition, disposal of substantially all or all assets, reverse takeover, dissolution, the plan administrator should in its discretion provide for replacement or assumption of such award. In the event of other changes, the compensation committee should in its discretion make adjustments in the number and class of shares subject to awards outstanding on the date of such change to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights. The 2009 and 2010 plans will expire and no further awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the plan was adopted. China Linongs 2007 share incentive plan provides that the board of directors have the right to amend, suspend or terminate the plan. Amendments to the plan are subject to shareholders approval to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plans, change the minimum purchase price for the optioned shares, or extend the term or the option period beyond ten years from the date of grant. Unless terminated earlier, the plan will expire and no further awards may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the plan took effect. As of June 30, 2012, we have granted options to purchase a total of 196,265,000 ordinary shares to our directors and executive officers with exercise prices of $0.0729 per share, $0.0757 per share, $0.08 per share or $0.143 per share under our share incentive plans, including options which had been exercised to purchase 44,128,000 ordinary shares.

Financial Information A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal and Administrative Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not aware of any proceedings being contemplated by any governmental authority. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation or legal proceedings that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends, nor do we have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to declare and pay dividends. Our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare dividends or distributions, but no dividend or distribution may exceed the amount recommended by our directors. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. If we pay any dividends, we will pay such dividends as are attributable to the shares represented by our ADSs to the depositary, which shall in turn pay such dividends to our ADS holders, upon and subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars. 68 Table of Contents We are a holding company, and we rely on dividends paid by our operating subsidiaries in China for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. The payment of dividends in China is subject to limitations. Regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations in China. Our PRC subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year to contribute to their respective reserve funds until the accumulated balance of the reserve funds reach 50% of their respective registered capital. They are also required to reserve a portion of their after-tax profits to their employee welfare and bonus fund, the amount of which is determined by their respective board of directors. These funds are not distributable in cash dividends. B.

Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands or at such other place as our directors may from time to time decide. The objects for which our company is established are unrestricted and we have full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the Companies Law or as the same may be revised from time to time, or any other law of the Cayman Islands. Board of Directors See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesC. Board PracticesBoard of Directors. Ordinary Shares All of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Certificates representing the ordinary shares are issued in registered form. Shareholders who are nonresidents of the Cayman Islands may freely hold and vote their shares. Dividends The holders of our ordinary shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors subject to the Companies Law. Voting Rights Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote. Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by the chairman of our board of directors or by any one or more or our shareholders present in person or by proxy who together hold not less than 10% of the paid up voting share capital of our company. A quorum required for a meeting of shareholders consists of shareholders who hold at least one-third of our ordinary shares at the meeting present in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative. Shareholders meetings may be convened by our board of directors on its own initiative or upon a request to the directors by shareholders holding in aggregate at least one-third in par value of our voting share capital. Advance notice of at least 21 clear calendar days is required for the convening of our annual general meeting and other shareholders meetings. An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes attaching to our ordinary shares cast in a general meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes attaching to our ordinary shares cast in a general meeting. A special resolution will be required for important matters such as a change of name or making changes to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 70 Table of Contents Transfer of Shares Subject to the restrictions of our articles of association, as applicable, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our board. Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share which is not fully paid up or on which we have a lien. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless (a) the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary shares to which it relates and such other evidence as our board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares; (c) the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required; (d) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the ordinary share is to be transferred does not exceed four; or (e) the shares transferred are free of any lien in favor of us. If our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal. The registration of transfers may, on 14 days notice being given by advertisement in such one or more newspapers or by electronic means, be suspended and the register of members closed at such times and for such periods as our board of directors may from time to time determine, provided however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register be closed for more than 30 days in any year. Liquidation On a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), assets available for distribution among the holders of ordinary shares shall be distributed among the holders of the ordinary shares on a pro rata basis. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately. Calls on Shares and Forfeiture of Shares Our board of directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture. Redemption, Repurchase and Surrender of Shares We may issue shares on terms that such shares are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders thereof, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our board, before the issue of such shares. Our company may also repurchase any of our shares provided that the manner of such purchase has been approved by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders or the manner of purchase is in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Under the Companies Law, the redemption or repurchase of any share may be paid out of our companys profits or share premium account or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of such redemption of repurchase, or out of capital if our company shall, immediately following such payment, be able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, under the Company Law no such share may be redeemed or repurchased (a) unless it is fully paid up, (b) if such redemption or repurchase would result in there being no shares outstanding, or (c) our company has commenced liquidation. In addition, our company may accept the surrender of any fully paid share for no consideration. Variation of Rights of Shares All or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, be varied either with the written consent of the holders of a majority of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. Inspection of Books and Records Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records. However, we will provide our shareholders with annual audited financial statements. See Item 10. Additional Information  H. Documents on Display. 71 Table of Contents Anti-takeover Provisions in Our Memorandum and Articles of Association Some provisions of our memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including a provision that authorizes our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders. Such shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue these preference shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. However, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our memorandum and articles of association for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company. C. Material Contracts We have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in 
