Item 1A Risk Factors. The following risk factors, as well as other information included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be considered by investors in connection with any investment in the Company’s common stock. As used in this Item, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the Company and its subsidiaries. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Significant Customers We are significantly dependent on our contractual relationship with FedEx Corporation, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, 50% of our consolidated operating revenues, and 99% of the operating revenues for our overnight air cargo segment, arose from services we provided to FedEx. Our agreements with FedEx are renewable on two to five-year terms and may be terminated by FedEx at any time upon 30 days’ notice. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. The loss of these contracts with FedEx would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Because of our dependence on FedEx, we are subject to the risks that may affect FedEx’s operations. These risks are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Risk Factors” in FedEx Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007. These risks include: · Economic conditions in the global markets in which it operates; · Any impacts on its business resulting from new domestic or international government regulation, including regulatory actions affecting aviation rights, security requirements, tax, accounting, environmental or labor rules; · The price and availability of fuel; · The impact of any international conflicts or terrorist activities on the United States and global economies in general, the transportation industry in particular, and what effects these events will have on the cost and demand for its services; · Dependence on its strong reputation and value of its brand; · Reliance upon technology, including the internet; · Competition from other providers of transportation services, including its ability to compete with new or improved services offered by its competitors; · The impact of technology developments on its operations and on demand for its services; and · Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters. A material reduction in the aircraft we fly for FedEx could materially adversely affect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with FedEx, we are not guaranteed a number of aircraft or routes we are to fly. Our compensation under these agreements, including our administrative fees, depends on the number of aircraft leased to us by FedEx. Any material permanent reduction in the aircraft we operate could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. A temporary reduction could materially adversely affect our results of operations for that period. If our agreement with the United States Air Force expires in June 2009 as scheduled, and is not extended or renewed, we may be unable to replace revenues from sales of ground equipment to the United States Air Force and seasonal patterns of this segment of our business may re-emerge. In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 20% and 24%, respectively, of our operating revenues arose from sales of deicing equipment to the United States Air Force under a long-term contract. This initial four-year contract, awarded in 1999, was extended for two additional three-year periods, and is scheduled to expire in June 2009. We cannot provide any assurance that this agreement will be extended beyond its current 2009 expiration date. In the event that this agreement is not extended, our revenues from sales of ground support equipment may decrease unless we are successful in obtaining customer orders from other sources and we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure orders in that quantity or for the fully-equipped models of equipment sold to the Air Force. In addition, sales of deicing equipment to the Air Force, has enabled us to ameliorate the seasonality of our ground equipment business. Thus if the contract with the Air Force is not extended, seasonal patterns for this business may re-emerge. 7 Other Business Risks Our revenues for aircraft maintenance services fluctuate based on the heavy maintenance check schedule, which is based on aircraft usage, for aircraft flown by our overnight air cargo operations. Our maintenance revenues fluctuate based on the level of heavy maintenance checks performed on aircraft operated by our air cargo operations. Incidents or accidents involving products and services that we sell may result in liability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results for a period. Incidents or accidents may occur involving the products and services that we sell. While we maintain products liability and other insurance in amounts we believe are customary and appropriate, and may have rights to pursue subcontractors in the event that we have any liability in connection with accidents involving products that we sell, it is possible that in the event of multiple accidents the amount of our insurance coverage would not be adequate. The suspension or revocation of FAA certifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our air cargo operations are subject to regulations of the FAA. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. Our air cargo subsidiaries, MAC and CSA, operate under separate FAA certifications. Although it is possible that, in the event that the certification of one of our subsidiaries was suspended or revoked, flights operated by that subsidiary could be transferred to the other subsidiary, we can offer no assurance that we would be able to transfer flight operations in that manner. Accordingly, the suspension or revocation of any one of these certifications could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial position. The suspension or revocation of all of these certifications would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Sales of deicing equipment can be affected by weather conditions. Our deicing equipment is used to deice commercial and military aircraft. The extent of deicing activity depends on the severity of winter weather. Mild winter weather conditions permit airports to use fewer deicing units, since less time is required to deice aircraft in mild weather conditions. Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable.
