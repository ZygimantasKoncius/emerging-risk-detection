Risk Factors. Factors That May Affect Future Results (Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by Mattel or its representatives in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other filings or reports filed with the SEC, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and may include, but are not limited to, statements about: sales and inventory levels; brand and customer management programs; increased competition; initiatives to promote revenue growth; globalization initiatives; restructuring and financial realignment plans; special charges and other non-recurring charges; initiatives aimed at anticipated cost savings; initiatives to invigorate the Barbie® brand, improve the execution of the core business, extend brands, catch new trends, create new brands and enter new categories, develop people, improve productivity, simplify processes, maintain customer service levels and improve supply chain; operating efficiencies; capital and investment framework (including statements about free cash flow, seasonal working capital, debt-to-total capital ratios, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases); cost increases; advertising and promotion spending; profitability; and the impact of recent organizational changes. Mattel is including this Cautionary Statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, may, will, should, project, continue, plans, aims, intends, likely, or other similar words or phrases. Except for historical matters, the matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other statements or filings made by Mattel from time-to-time may be forward-looking statements. Management cautions you that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. In addition to the important factors detailed herein and from time-to-time in other reports filed by Mattel with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, the following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from past results or those suggested by any forward-looking statements. If Mattel does not successfully satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products and achieve market acceptance of those products, Mattels results of operations may be adversely affected. Mattels business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its toy products. Consumer preferences, particularly among end users of Mattels productschildrenare continuously changing. The toy industry experiences significant, sudden shifts in demand caused by hit toys and trends, which are often unpredictable. Mattel competes with many other toy companies, both large and small, which means that Mattels market position is always at risk. Mattels ability to maintain its current category share, and increase its category share or establish category share in new product categories, will depend on Mattels ability to satisfy consumer preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and achieve market acceptance of these products. In recent years there have been trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products, the 13 Table of Contents phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at younger ages and an increasing use of more sophisticated technology in toys. As a result, Mattel must also compete with many other companies, including the makers of video games and consumer electronic products, to meet the entertainment demands of older children. If Mattel does not successfully meet the challenges outlined above in a timely and cost-effective manner, demand for its products could decrease and Mattels revenues, profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected. Mattels business is seasonal and therefore its annual operating results will depend, in large part, on sales during the relatively brief traditional holiday season. Improved inventory management by retailers resulting in shorter lead times for production and possible shipping disruptions during peak demand times may affect Mattels ability to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demands. Mattels business is subject to risks associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Sales of toy products at retail are seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December. As a result, Mattels annual operating results will depend, in large part, on sales during the relatively brief traditional holiday season. Retailers are attempting to manage their inventories better, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. This in turn results in shorter lead times for production. Management believes that the increase in last minute shopping during the holiday season and the popularity of gift cards (which often result in purchases after the holiday season) may negatively impact customer re-orders during the holiday season. Shipping disruptions limiting the availability of ships or containers in Asia during peak demand times may affect Mattels ability to deliver its products in time to meet retailer demand. These factors may decrease sales or increase the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times, or that Mattels own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which Mattel participates may negatively affect Mattels business. Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the many different markets in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattels budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Adverse changes may occur as a result of soft global or regional economic conditions, rising oil prices, wavering consumer confidence, unemployment, declines in stock markets or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of Mattels products, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. The concentration of Mattels business with a small retail customer base that make no binding long-term commitments means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of its major customers could have a significant impact on Mattels business and operating results. A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattels net sales. In 2005 Mattels three largest customers, Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 45% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 54% of net sales. The concentration of Mattels business with a relatively small number of customers may expose Mattel to a material adverse effect if one or more of Mattels large customers were to significantly reduce purchases for any reason. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to Mattel regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchases of Mattels products, reduce the number and variety of Mattels products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for Mattels products, or otherwise seek to materially change the terms of the business relationship at any time. Any such change could significantly harm Mattels business and operating results. 14 Table of Contents The production and sale of private-label toys by Mattels retail customers may result in lower purchases of Mattel-branded products by those retail customers. In recent years, consumer goods companies generally, including those in the toy business, have experienced the phenomenon of retail customers developing their own private-label products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers. Some retail chains that are customers of Mattel sell private-label toys designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These toys may be sold at prices lower than comparable toys sold by Mattel, and may result in lower purchases of Mattel-branded products by these retailers. In some cases, retailers who sell these private-label toys are larger than Mattel and may have substantially more resources than Mattel. Liquidity problems or bankruptcy of Mattels key customers could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts and could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of Mattels key customers are mass-market retailers. The mass-market retail channel in the US has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. From 2001 through early 2004, four large customers of Mattel filed for bankruptcy. In addition, Mattels sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy or other factors beyond the control of Mattel, which could increase Mattels exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if these or other customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy, or significantly reduce the number of stores operated, it could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. A reduction or interruption in the delivery of raw materials, parts and components from its suppliers or a significant increase in the price of supplies could negatively impact the gross profit margins realized by Mattel on the sale of its products or result in lower sales. Mattels ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on its ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from its suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity. Mattel has experienced shortages in the past, including raw materials and components. Although Mattel works closely with suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no assurance that Mattel will not encounter these problems in the future. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies, such as fuel and resin (which is an oil-based product) expenses, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business. Cost increases, whether resulting from shortages of materials or otherwise, including but not limited to rising costs of materials, transportation, services and labor (including but not limited to wages, expenses related to employee health plans and insurance), could impact the profit margins realized by Mattel on the sale of its products. Because of market conditions, timing of pricing decisions and other factors, there can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to offset any of these increased costs by adjusting the prices of its products. Increases in prices of Mattels products could result in lower sales. Unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on Mattels financial condition. Mattel is involved in a number of litigation matters. An unfavorable resolution of pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on Mattels financial condition. Litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of Mattels management regardless of the outcome. There can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to achieve a favorable settlement of pending litigation or obtain a favorable resolution of litigation if it is not settled. In addition, current and future litigation, governmental proceedings, labor disputes or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of the normal business operations of Mattel. 15 Table of Contents Recalls, post-manufacture repairs of Mattel products, absence or cost of insurance, and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm Mattels reputation, increase costs or reduce sales. Mattel is subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state and international regulatory authorities, and its products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by these authorities. Concerns about product safety may lead Mattel to voluntarily recall selected products. Mattel has experienced, and in the future may experience, defects or errors in products after their production and sale to customers. These defects or errors could result in the rejection of Mattels products by customers, damage to its reputation, lost sales, diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs, any of which could harm Mattels business. Individuals could sustain injuries from Mattels products, and Mattel may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from these injuries. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, Mattels insurance coverage. Moreover, Mattel may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. Recalls, post-manufacture repairs of Mattel products, absence or cost of insurance, and administrative costs associated with recalls could harm Mattels reputation, increase costs or reduce sales. Failure by Mattel to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. The value of Mattels business depends to a large degree on its ability to protect its intellectual property, including its trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets in the US and around the world. Any failure by Mattel to protect its proprietary intellectual property and information, including any successful challenge to Mattels ownership of its intellectual property or material infringements of its intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Political developments, including trade relations, and the threat or occurrence of war or terrorist activities could materially impact Mattel, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, retail and financial markets, and general economic conditions. Mattels business is worldwide in scope, including operations in 42 countries. The deterioration of the political situation in a country in which Mattel has significant sales or operations, or the breakdown of trade relations between the US and a foreign country in which Mattel has significant manufacturing facilities or other operations, could adversely affect Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a change in trade status for China could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of toys manufactured in China and imported into the US. In addition, the occurrence of war or hostilities between countries or threat of terrorist activities, and the responses to and results of these activities, could materially impact Mattel, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, retail and financial markets, and general economic conditions. Disruptions in Mattels manufacturing operations due to political instability, civil unrest, SARS, avian flu or other diseases could negatively impact Mattels business, financial position and results of operations. Mattel owns and operates manufacturing facilities and utilizes third-party manufacturers throughout Asia, primarily in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The risk of political instability and civil unrest exists in certain of these countries, which could temporarily or permanently damage Mattels manufacturing operations located there. In the past, outbreaks of SARS have been significantly concentrated in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong, and in the Guangdong province of China, where many of Mattels manufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturers are located. The design, development and manufacture of Mattels products could suffer if a significant number of Mattels employees or the employees of its third-party manufacturers or their suppliers contract SARS, avian flu or other communicable diseases, or otherwise are unable to fulfill their responsibilities. Mattel has developed contingency plans designed to help mitigate the impact of disruptions in its manufacturing operations. Mattels business, financial position and results of operations could be negatively impacted by a significant disruption to its manufacturing operations or suppliers. 16 Table of Contents Earthquakes or other catastrophic events out of our control may damage Mattels facilities or those of its contractors and harm Mattels results of operations. Mattel has significant operations, including its corporate headquarters, near major earthquake faults in Southern California. Southern California has experienced earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in recent years. A catastrophic event where Mattel has important operations, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood, typhoon, fire or other natural or manmade disaster, could disrupt Mattels operations or those of its contractors and impair production or distribution of its products, damage inventory, interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect business negatively, harming Mattels results of operations. Significant changes in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business and results of operations. Mattels net investment in its foreign subsidiaries and its results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in currency exchange rates and regulations. Mattel seeks to mitigate the exposure of its results of operations to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by partially hedging this exposure using foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts. These contracts are primarily used to hedge Mattels purchase and sale of inventory, and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Government action may restrict Mattels ability to transfer capital across borders and may also impact the fluctuation of currencies in the countries where Mattel conducts business or has invested capital. Significant changes in currency exchange rates, reductions in Mattels ability to transfer its capital across borders, and changes in government-fixed currency exchange rates, including the Chinese yuan, could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business and results of operations. Increases in interest rates, reduction of Mattels credit ratings or the inability of Mattel to meet the debt covenant coverage requirements in its credit facilities could negatively impact Mattels ability to conduct its operations. Increases in interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could negatively affect Mattels cost of financing both its operations and investments. Any reduction in Mattels credit ratings could increase the cost of obtaining financing. Additionally, Mattels ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as an inability to meet its debt covenant requirements, which include maintaining consolidated debt-to-capital and interest coverage ratios. Mattels ability to conduct its operations could be negatively impacted should these or other adverse conditions affect its primary sources of liquidity. Mattels failure to successfully market or advertise its products could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Mattels products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Mattels ability to sell products is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If Mattel does not successfully market its products or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase, these factors could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to successfully implement new initiatives could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Mattel has announced initiatives to improve the execution of its core business, globalize and extend Mattels brands, catch new trends, create new brands and enter new categories, develop people, improve productivity, simplify processes, maintain customer service levels, as well as new initiatives designed to drive sales growth, manage costs and improve its supply chain. These initiatives involve complex decision making as well as extensive and intensive execution, and the success of these initiatives is not assured. Failure to successfully implement any of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs, changes in Mattels effective tax rate, or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact Mattels financial condition and results of operations. Mattel operates in a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. US federal, state and local governmental entities and foreign governments regulate many aspects of Mattels business, including its products and the importation and exportation of its products. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including changes in applicable income tax rates, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), trade restrictions, regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, advertising directed toward children, safety and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. Changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs, changes in Mattels effective tax rate, or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations. Mattel may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of Mattels business. In addition, Mattel has certain anti-takeover provisions in its by-laws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mattel without its consent, which may adversely affect Mattels stock price. Mattel may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures, or other aspects of Mattels business. There can be no assurance that Mattel will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or that, if identified, it will be able to acquire these targets on acceptable terms or agree to terms with merger partners. Additionally, there can be no assurance that Mattel will be successful in integrating any acquired company into its overall operations, or that any such acquired company will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact Mattels results of operations. In addition, Mattel has certain anti-takeover provisions in its bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Mattel without its consent, which may adversely affect Mattels stock price. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors listed above actually occurs, Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact Mattels business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, Mattel operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all of these factors on Mattels business, financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other public statement made by Mattel or its representatives may turn out to be wrong. Mattel expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
