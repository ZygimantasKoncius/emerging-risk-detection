MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW AVANT's principal activity since our inception has been research and product development conducted on our own behalf, as well as through joint development programs with several pharmaceutical companies and other collaborators. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 1983. AVANT's focus is unlocking the power of the immune system to prevent and treat disease. We have assembled a broad portfolio of technologies and intellectual property that give us a strong competitive position in vaccines and immunotherapeutics. AVANT has three products on the market, including an oral human rotavirus vaccine, which has gained marketing approval in over 100 countries worldwide and is being commercialized by Glaxo, and four of AVANT's products are in clinical development. AVANT's pipeline includes products for travelers' vaccines and global health needs based on AVANT's oral, rapid-protecting, single-dose and temperature stable vaccine technology. The marriage of innovative bacterial vector delivery technologies with unique manufacturing processes offers the potential for a new generation of vaccines. The Company's goal is to become a leading developer of innovative vaccines and immunotherapeutics that address health care needs on a global basis. We have actively developed and acquired innovative technologiesespecially novel approaches to vaccine creation. Today our broad intellectual property position allows us to respond quickly and leverage our expertise into many different areas as opportunities and needs arise. AVANT is targeting its efforts where it can add the greatest value to the development of its products and technologies. Our goal is to demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for each product, and then seek excellent partners to help see those products through to commercialization. This approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolios while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product. On October 22, 2007, AVANT and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. ("Celldex"), a privately-held company, announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement (the"Merger"). On March 7, 2008, AVANT announced the completed Merger of Callisto Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of AVANT, with and into Celldex. The Merger has created a NASDAQ-listed and diversified biopharmaceutical company with a pipeline of product candidates addressing indications in oncology, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The total value of the Merger transaction is approximately $75 million. At the special meeting of AVANT shareholders held on March 6, 2008 in connection with the Merger, stockholders approved four proposals: (i) the issuance of shares of AVANT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in the amount necessary to result in the Celldex stockholders owning 58% of AVANT common stock on a fully diluted basis, (ii) an amendment to AVANT's Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares to 300,000,000, (iii) an amendment to AVANT's Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split in a ratio ranging from one-for-twelve to one-for-twenty of all the issued and outstanding shares of AVANT common stock, the final ratio to be determined within the discretion of the AVANT board of directors and (iv) adoption of the 2008 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. AVANT's board of directors approved a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of AVANT's common stock, which became effective on March 7, 2008. As a result of the reverse stock split, each twelve shares of common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of common stock and the total number of shares outstanding was reduced from approximately 180 million shares (including the shares issued to Celldex stockholders in the merger) to approximately 15 million shares. Also, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Celldex shareholders received 4.96 shares of common stock in exchange for each share of Celldex common stock and Class A common stock they 41 own. AVANT stockholders retained 42% of, and the former Celldex stockholders now own 58% of, the outstanding shares of AVANT's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. AVANT also assumed all of Celldex's stock options outstanding at the time of the Merger. Our common stock continues to trade under the symbol "AVAND" for 20 trading days starting March 10, 2008 to designate that it is trading on a post-reverse split basis, and will resume trading under the symbol "AVAN" after the 20-day period expires on April 7, 2008. Acquisitions Universal Preservation Technologies, Inc. ("UPT"): In January 2003, AVANT completed the acquisition of certain technology and intellectual property of UPT, a privately held company, and the licensure of certain patent rights from Elan Drug Delivery Limited ("EDD"), a subsidiary of Elan Corporation plc. EDD's license to AVANT gives AVANT exclusive rights to the VitriLife® process for use in orally administered vaccines and certain other non-injectable applications, and non-exclusive rights in certain other fields. VitriLife® is a patented drying method for the industrial-scale preservation of biological solutions and suspensions, such as proteins, enzymes, viruses, bacteria and other cells, which has the potential to cut production costs and improve product stability at room temperature or higher. AVANT has determined that this technology has alternative future uses and will be incorporated into a number of AVANT's bacterial vaccine programs. AVANT paid an aggregate of $2,000,000 in consideration in the transaction, recorded this value to acquired intangible assets, and is amortizing these assets over their estimated lives of ten years. Megan Health, Inc. ("Megan"): On December 1, 2000, AVANT acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Megan, a company engaged in the discovery and development of human and animal vaccines using patented gene modification technologies. In connection with the acquisition, AVANT recorded a charge of $9,012,300 for acquired in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), which represented purchased in-process technology which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. As of December 31, 2007, none of the acquired research and development projects had reached technological feasibility. Virus Research Institute, Inc. ("VRI"): On August 21, 1998, AVANT acquired VRI, a company engaged in the discovery and development of systems for the delivery of vaccines and immunotherapeutics, and novel vaccines for adults and children. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded a charge of $44,630,000 for acquired IPR&D, which represented purchased in-process technology which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. As of December 31, 2007, none of the acquired research and development projects had reached technological feasibility, except for the rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix®. Research and Development Activities AVANT is currently focused on the development of a number of vaccine and immunotherapeutic product candidates which are in various stages of clinical trials. We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trial programs. The expenditures that will be necessary to execute AVANT's business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more, and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. It is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of product candidates to each take five years or more, and for total development costs to exceed $100 million for each product 42 candidate. AVANT estimates that clinical trials of the type AVANT generally conducts are typically completed over the following timelines: Clinical Phase Estimated Completion Period Phase 1 1-2 Years Phase 2 1-5 Years Phase 3 1-5 Years The duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol, including, among others, the following: the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial; the duration of patient follow-up that seems appropriate in view of results; the number of clinical sites included in the trials; the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate. AVANT tests potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety, toxicology and immunogenicity. AVANT then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product candidate. As we obtain results from trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates. An element of AVANT's business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of product candidates. This is intended to allow AVANT to diversify the risks associated with its research and development expenditures. As a result, AVANT believes its future capital requirements and its future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product candidate. To the extent AVANT is unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates, AVANT's dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates increases. AVANT's product candidates also have not yet received FDA regulatory approval, which is required before AVANT can market them as therapeutic or vaccine products. In order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval, the FDA must conclude that AVANT's clinical data establish safety and efficacy. Historically, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials (through Phase 2) have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. A number of new drugs, biologics and vaccines have shown promising results in early clinical trials, but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Furthermore, AVANT's business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of AVANT's product candidates. In the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of AVANT's product candidates, the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than AVANT. AVANT cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products, if any, will be subject to future collaborative arrangements, in whole or in part, and how such arrangements would affect AVANT's development plan or capital requirements. AVANT's programs may also benefit from subsidies, grants, contracts or government or agency-sponsored studies that could reduce AVANT's development costs. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, among others, AVANT is unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of its research and development projects or when, if ever, and to what extent it will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product. AVANT's inability to complete its research and development projects in a timely manner or its failure to enter into collaborative agreements, when appropriate, could significantly increase its capital requirements and 43 could adversely impact its liquidity. These uncertainties could force AVANT to seek additional, external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with its business strategy. AVANT's inability to raise additional capital, or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to it, would jeopardize the future success of its business. The amount incurred for each material research program since the beginning of 2003, is set forth below under "Program Developments." During the past five years through the end of 2007, AVANT incurred an aggregate of $74 million in research and development costs. During the year ended December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred an aggregate of $18 million in research and development costs. The following table indicates the amount incurred for each of AVANT's material research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The amounts disclosed in the following table and in "Program Developments" below reflect direct research and development costs, license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program. 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Bacterial Vaccines: CholeraGarde® $ 2,156,700 $ 5,427,800 $ 1,257,200 $ 123,100 $ 695,800 Ty800 6,435,000 1,402,300 404,500 688,300 186,300 ETEC 3,736,100 1,034,600 349,700 276,700 60,900 Other 883,900 839,000 179,200 55,800 76,600 BioDefense Vaccines: 204,500 1,558,600 2,470,700 3,082,800 3,524,500 Food Safety & Animal Health Vaccines:  6,700 9,900 12,600 49,400 Viral Vaccines: Rotarix® vaccine 2,061,200 648,600  500,000 200,000 Avian Flu 838,400 711,600 4,200   Cholesterol Management Vaccine: CETi 283,500 922,700 650,800 816,900 3,404,000 Complement Inhibitors: TP10/TP20 1,601,800 4,466,400 8,327,200 7,706,300 1,648,700 Other Programs: 294,700 1,048,200 409,900 611,300 175,100 Total R&D Expense $ 18,495,800 $ 18,066,500 $ 14,063,300 $ 13,873,800 $ 10,021,300 Program Developments Rotavirus Vaccine: Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children. In 1997, AVANT licensed its oral rotavirus vaccine to GlaxoSmithKline ("Glaxo"). All of the ongoing development and commercialization for this program is being conducted and funded by Glaxo. Glaxo gained approval for Rotarix® in Mexico during 2004, which represented the first in a series of worldwide approvals and commercial launches for the product. During 2005, Glaxo launched Rotarix® in additional Latin American countries as well as Asia Pacific countries, and filed for market approval with the European regulatory authorities, which triggered a $2 million milestone fee payable to AVANT. In February 2006, the European Commission granted approval of Rotarix® in the European Union, which triggered a $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo. Rotarix® is now licensed in over 70 countries worldwide in addition to the European Union market. Glaxo filed a Biologics License Application (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for United States market approval in 2007. On February 20, 2008, Rotarix® received a favorable recommendation from the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). The committee's favorable recommendation, although not binding, will be considered by the FDA in its review of the BLA for the candidate vaccine, which is currently underway. Glaxo has agreed to make an additional payment of $1.5 million upon achievement of market approval in the United States, $750,000 of which AVANT will retain. 44 AVANT licensed the Rotarix® technology in 1995 from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center ("CCH") and owes CCH a license fee of 30% on net royalties received from Glaxo. In May 2005, AVANT entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of Paul Royalty Fund ("PRF") purchased an interest in the net royalties AVANT will receive on worldwide sales of Rotarix®. Under the PRF agreement, AVANT retained 50% of the $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo for the European Commission approval discussed above and of any future Glaxo milestone payments, with the balance payable to PRF and CCH. The PRF agreement also provides for a $10 million milestone payment to AVANT if Rotarix® is launched in the United States in 2008. AVANT expects to achieve this milestone in the second half of 2008. Royalty rates on Rotarix® escalate from 7% to 10% based on net product sales in countries that have valid patent protection. These royalty rates are discounted by 30% for "non-patent" countries (primarily international markets). In September 2006, AVANT received notice from Glaxo that Glaxo would begin paying royalties on sales of Rotarix® vaccine at the lower of the two royalty rates under their 1997 license agreement. Glaxo's decision to pay the lower royalty rate (which is 70% of the full rate) is based upon Glaxo's assertion that Rotarix® is not covered by the patents Glaxo licensed from AVANT in Australia and certain European countries. AVANT is determined to take all available steps to enforce its rights under its license agreement with Glaxo. If Glaxo's position stands, the royalties to which PRF is entitled will no longer be limited by a $27.5 million annual threshold, which AVANT projected may have been reached in later years as sales of Rotarix® increased. Irrespective of Glaxo's position, AVANT will still retain the royalties on worldwide sales of Rotarix® once PRF receives 2.45 times the aggregate cash payments it makes to AVANT, though the potential amount of such residual royalties will be lower if Glaxo's position stands. Bacterial Vaccines: AVANT's goal is to become a leading developer of innovative bacterial vaccines that address health care needs on a global basis. In this regard, AVANT acquired VitriLife®, a technology with the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and improve product stability, eliminating the need for vaccine refrigeration during shipping and storage. With this technology and AVANT's Cholera- and Salmonella-vectored delivery technologies, named VibrioVec® and SalmoVec®, AVANT can now develop a new generation of vaccines that have an ideal product profile: safe, effective, oral, single-dose, rapidly protective and increased thermostability. Development of a safe and effective cholera vaccine is the first step in establishing AVANT's single-dose, oral bacterial vaccine franchise. In December 2002, the International Vaccine Institute ("IVI") initiated a Phase 2 study of CholeraGarde® in Bangladesh where cholera is endemic. In July 2005, Bangladesh study results in children and infants showed CholeraGarde® to be well tolerated and highly immunogenic, with 77% of children aged 9 months to 5 years generating protective immune responses. Previously published results showed the vaccine to be well tolerated and immunogenic against the cholera organism in the adult portion of this trial. In August 2006, IVI received $21 million in funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a Cholera Vaccine Initiative ("CHOVI"), which will include conducting further clinical trials of CholeraGarde®. IVI plans to conduct Phase 2 clinical trials of CholeraGarde® in Bangladesh and India beginning in 2008 followed by Phase 3 field studies. IVI will be purchasing clinical materials produced at AVANT's Fall River, Massachusetts manufacturing facility for the trials. AVANT has decided to focus only on the fully-funded opportunity for CholeraGarde® in the developing world. AVANT has determined that the high clinical costs of our own Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States and the investment in a commercial manufacturing facility are not justified by the limited market opportunities for a cholera vaccine in developed countries at this time. This decision frees up both financial and manufacturing resources for our Ty800 and ETEC programs. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $9.7 million in research, development and clinical costs on its CholeraGarde® program. 45 AVANT is also developing an oral typhoid fever vaccine, Ty800, for the travelers' market and global health needs. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ("NIAID") of the National Institutes of Health ("NIH") and AVANT agreed for the NIAID to conduct a Phase 1/2 in-patient dose-ranging clinical trial aimed at demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of the Ty800 vaccine. NIAID has funded the production of Ty800 vaccine for clinical testing and completed the Phase 1/2 trial at a NIH-funded clinical site. Results showed the single-dose, oral vaccine to be well tolerated and immunogenic, with over 90% of vaccinated subjects generating immune responses. AVANT initiated its own sponsored Phase 2 trial of Ty800 in July 2007. Enrollment was completed in late September 2007 and results are expected in the first half of 2008. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $9.1 million in research, development, contract manufacturing and clinical costs on its Ty800 program. Finally, AVANT is developing additional bacterial vaccines against enterotoxigenic E. coli ("ETEC"), Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella,all important causes of serious diarrheal diseases worldwide. These programs are in pre-clinical development. In November 2007, AVANT entered into an agreement with the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the NIAID, whereby NIAID will sponsor a Phase 1 study of AVANT's investigational single-dose, oral vaccine designed to offer combined protection against both enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and cholera. AVANT expects NIAID to initiate the Phase 1 trial of its ETEC vaccine candidate in the first half of 2008. AVANT's long-term goal is to develop a combination vaccine containing Cholera, Ty800, S. paratyphi and ETEC as a "super enteric vaccine" to address the travelers' market. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $7.4 million in research, development, contract manufacturing and clinical costs on these pre-clinical programs. BioDefense Vaccines: The attenuated live bacteria used to create AVANT's single-dose oral vaccines can also serve as vectors for the development of vaccines against other bacterial and viral diseases. In January 2003, AVANT was awarded a subcontract by Dynport Vaccine Company ("DVC") to develop for the U.S. Department of Defense an oral combination vaccine against anthrax and plague using AVANT's proprietary vaccine technologies. AVANT has received a number of additional subcontract modifications from DVC to support further development and pre-clinical animal testing of vaccine constructs of anthrax and plague vaccine candidates. As a result of AVANT's restructuring in 2007, the Company is no longer investing its resources in biodefense research and development activities and terminated its contracts with DVC as of September 30, 2007. AVANT does not expect future revenues from the biodefense vaccine programs. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, AVANT recognized $250,491 and $1,157,381, respectively, in government contract revenue from DVC. Through December 31, 2007, AVANT had received approximately $9.7 million in payments under the subcontract agreements. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $10.8 million in research and development costs on its biodefense vaccine program. Food Safety and Animal Health Vaccines: AVANT has partnered with Pfizer Inc ("Pfizer"), who will apply AVANT's vaccine technologies to animal health and human food safety markets. The Pfizer research program achieved an important milestone in late 2002, which resulted in a payment of $500,000 to AVANT. As of June 1, 2006, AVANT entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with Pfizer aimed at the discovery and development of vaccines to protect animals. Under the agreement, Pfizer and AVANT conducted a joint research program funded by Pfizer. In 2007, Pfizer terminated the arrangement after AVANT provided two of four deliverables to Pfizer. AVANT recognized revenue as the research and development service deliverables were completed and delivered to Pfizer. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $78,600 in research and development costs on its food safety and animal health vaccines program. 46 Complement Inhibitors: In February 2006, AVANT reported that the Phase 2b females-only study did not meet its primary endpoint, thus confirming the results for female subjects in the previous TP10 Phase 2 trial. AVANT is currently spending limited resources on this program and is seeking a corporate partner to complete the development and commercialization of TP10. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $23.7 million in research, development, contract manufacturing and clinical costs associated with its complement inhibitor program. Cholesterol Management Vaccine: AVANT has been developing an immunotherapeutic vaccine against endogenous cholesteryl ester transfer protein ("CETP"), which may be useful in reducing risks associated with atherosclerosis. CETP is a key intermediary in the balance of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein). The vaccine stimulates an immune response against CETP, which may improve the ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol and reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, which often leads to heart attack. AVANT is seeking a corporate partner to complete development and to commercialize a newly formulated CETP vaccine. During the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2007, AVANT incurred approximately $6.1 million in research, development and clinical costs associated with the CETP program. Technology Licensing AVANT has adopted a business strategy of out-licensing technology that does not match its development focus or where it lacks sufficient resources for the technology's efficient development. For example, when AVANT acquired Megan it also signed an agreement with Pfizer to leverage the value of Megan's oral vaccine technology in a significant market opportunity (animal health and human food safety) outside of AVANT's own focus on human health care. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for agreements entered into with various collaborators, the amortization policy for acquired intangible assets and the estimates of costs incurred and assumptions made in recording accrued clinical research and contract manufacturing costs and assumptions made in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation expense. Revenue Recognition: AVANT has entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of research and development, payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales. Non-refundable license fees are recognized as contract and license fee revenue when AVANT has a contractual right to receive such payments, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the contract price is fixed or determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and AVANT has no further performance obligations under the license agreement. When AVANT has performance obligations under the terms of a contract, non-refundable fees are recognized as revenue as AVANT completes its obligations. Where AVANT's level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. The determination of the performance period involves judgment on management's part. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line basis, as of the period ending date. Funding of research and development is recognized over the term of the applicable contract as costs are incurred related to that contract. Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone. Revenues from 47 milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone; and, the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as AVANT completes its performance obligations. Revenues from government contracts and grants are recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the government. Product royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize AVANT's licensed technologies and are recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement. Payments received in advance of activities being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. Any significant changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact our revenue recognition. Revenues from product sales would be recorded when the product is shipped providing no significant post-delivery obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. In May 2005, AVANT entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of PRF purchased an interest in the net royalties AVANT will receive on worldwide sales of Rotarix®. Rotarix® is licensed to Glaxo. The terms of the agreement with PRF include an upfront unconditional payment and future payments, upon achievement of specified milestones. In addition, AVANT retains some participation in the worldwide net royalty stream from Rotarix®. The PRF transaction qualifies as a sale in accordance with guidance in EITF 88-18 "Sale of Future Revenues". The upfront unconditional payment and any future milestone payments received from PRF will be recorded as deferred revenue. Revenues will be recognized and calculated based on the ratio of total royalties received from Glaxo and remitted to PRF over expected total amounts to be received by PRF and then applying this percentage to the total cumulative consideration received from PRF to date. The expected total of payments to be paid to PRF is an estimate which AVANT will update from time to time to determine that the estimate continues to be reasonable in the light of then current events and circumstances. Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted EITF 00-21, Accounting For Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement. The criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, whether the fair value of any undelivered item can be reliably determined and the customer's right of return for the delivered item. Long-Lived Assets: In the ordinary course of our business, we incur substantial costs to construct property and equipment. The treatment of costs to construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction. Costs incurred in the project planning and design phase, and in the construction and installation phase, are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. We stop capitalizing costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Determining the appropriate period during which to capitalize costs, and assessing whether particular costs qualify for capitalization, requires us to make significant judgments. These judgments can have a material impact on our reported results. For manufacturing property and equipment, we also capitalize the cost of validating these assets for the underlying manufacturing process. We complete the capitalization of validation costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs capitalized include incremental labor and fringe benefits, and direct consultancy services. Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Laboratory equipment and office furniture and equipment 48 are depreciated over a five year period and computer equipment is depreciated over a three year period. Manufacturing equipment is amortized over a seven to ten year period. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the noncancelable term of the related lease, including any renewals that are reasonably assured of occurring. Property and equipment under construction is classified as construction in progress and is depreciated or amortized only after the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of significant improvements which extend the life of the underlying asset are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the related gains or losses are reflected in net income. Determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results. Amortization of Intangible Assets: We have acquired intangible assets, which include core technology, developed technology and a strategic partner agreement, through the acquisition of Megan and UPT. These acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives which range from 5 to 17 years. The determination of the amortization period involves estimates and judgment on management's part. Any significant changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact the carrying value of acquired intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of these assets when facts and circumstances suggest the asset could be impaired in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets". As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, we ceased amortization of goodwill and perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired. On July 1, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we conducted an annual impairment assessment as required under SFAS No. 142 by comparing our fair value to our net assets, including goodwill, as of July 1, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Because our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets at July 1, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for potential impairment under SFAS No. 144. We perform these evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include: a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used; a significant decrease in the market value of an asset; a significant adverse change in its business or the industry in which it is sold; and a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset. If we believe an indicator of potential impairment exists, we test to determine whether impairment recognition criteria in SFAS No. 144 have been met. We charge impairments of the long-lived assets to operations if our evaluations indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable. Accounting for Patent Costs: We expense all patent costs as incurred. Certain patent costs are reimbursed by our product development and licensing partners. Any reimbursed patent costs are recorded as product development and licensing agreement revenues in our financial statements. Accrued Clinical Research and Contract Manufacturing Costs: The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported. Specifically, AVANT's 49 management must make estimates of costs incurred to date, but not yet invoiced by external entities such as clinical research organizations ("CROs") and contract manufacturers. For CROs, management analyzes the progress of clinical trials, invoices received, and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability. For contract manufacturers, management analyzes the progress of process development and scale-up efforts and the production of clinical materials, contract amendments signed for specific work, invoices received, and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period. Actual results may differ from the amount and timing of the accrued balance for any period. Restructuring Activities: In accordance with SFAS No. 146, the Company recognizes a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity and measures the amount of liability at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. Stock-Based Compensation Expense: On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," ("SFAS 123(R)") which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to its employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("employee stock purchases") based on estimated fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 1, 2006, the first day of the Company's fiscal year 2006. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared with Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2006 AVANT reported a net loss of $21,638,761, or $3.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $1,264,829, or 6.2%, compared to a net loss of $20,373,932, or $3.29 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net loss between periods was primarily due to increased operating expenses and decreased investment and other income, offset partially by increased revenues. The weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate the net loss per common share was 6,265,504 in 2007 and 6,184,704 in 2006 after adjustment for a reverse stock split of 1-for 12. Revenue Total revenue increased $171,833, or 3.5%, to $5,102,930 in 2007 from $4,931,097 in 2006. Product development and licensing revenue decreased $2,730,227 to $125,039 in 2007 from $2,855,266 in 2006. In February 2006, the European Commission granted approval of Rotarix® in the European Union, which triggered a one-time $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo, 50% of which was creditable against future royalties. Product development and licensing revenue of $2.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2006 and the remaining $1.4 million was remitted to PRF in accordance with the PRF agreement. AVANT received a number of subcontracts from DVC to develop anthrax and plague vaccines for the U.S. Department of Defense. We were reimbursed by DVC on a time and materials basis for vaccine development research work performed by us. AVANT terminated its arrangements with DVC in the third quarter of 2007. Under these agreements and several SBIR grants, AVANT recognized $491,345 and $1,408,434 in government contract and grant revenue during 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily reflects reduced levels of vaccine 50 development work billable to DVC in 2007 as AVANT closed down its biodefense development activities. Government grant revenue under an SBIR grant is expected in 2008. In 2007, AVANT recognized $4,370,621 in product royalty revenue consisting of $2,334,382 related to PRF's purchased interest in Rotarix® net royalties and $2,036,239 related to AVANT's retained interests in Rotarix® net royalties which were not sold to PRF and which is equal to the amount payable to CCH by AVANT. As such, a corresponding amount is recorded as royalty expense and included in research and development expense. In 2006, AVANT recognized $550,803 in product royalty revenue related to PRF's purchased interests in the net royalties from Rotarix® worldwide net sales. AVANT expects the amount of product royalty revenue to increase in 2008 as Glaxo continues the global commercialization of Rotarix® with an expected launch in the United States. Product royalty payments received by AVANT for Megan®Vac 1 and Megan®Egg product sales in 2007 and 2006 totaled $115,924 and $116,597, respectively. We expect royalty payments from LAHI to remain at current levels in 2008. Operating Expense Total operating expense increased $659,535, or 2.4%, to $27,957,891 in 2007 compared to $27,298,356 in 2006. The increase in total operating expense in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to increased research and development expenses as a result of increased royalty expense to CCH, increased clinical trial expense and increased general and administrative expenses. Research and development expense increased $429,396, or 2.4%, to $18,495,788 in 2007 compared to $18,066,392 in 2006. The increase in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to increased royalty expense of $1,436,239 payable to CCH for Rotarix® royalties received by AVANT. AVANT also experienced increases in clinical trials costs of $889,033 associated with the Ty800 Phase 1/2 clinical trial, increases in depreciation and amortization expenses of $613,190 due to the capitalization of leasehold improvements and new equipment purchased in connection with the renovation of our Needham facility and losses recorded on the disposal of equipment of $478,286. These increases were offset in part by decreases in research and development personnel and related costs of $471,451, consultant fees of $430,385, contract manufacturing costs of $1,583,693 and laboratory materials and, supplies of $519,531. We expect research and development expense to increase in 2008 as a result of the Celldex merger. General and administrative expense increased $265,039, or 3.2%, to $8,501,891 in 2007 compared to $8,236,854 in 2006. The increase in 2007 is primarily attributed to increases in legal fees, professional and consultant fees of $1,090,346 and other shareholder expenses of $127,281 primarily associated with our proposed Merger with Celldex and facility-related costs of $299,306. These increases are partly offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $1,273,622 due to expenses recorded in connection with the acceleration of restricted stock units in 2006 and a decrease in patent expenses of $83,959. AVANT expects general and administrative expense to increase in 2008 as a result of the Celldex Merger. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets was $960,212 in 2007 and $995,110 in 2006. Investment and Other Income, Net Net investment and other income decreased $1,017,127, or 48.1%, to $1,096,200 in 2007 compared to $2,113,327 in 2006. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, AVANT recognized a loss of $158,095 for the impairment of its investment in Select Vaccines that was determined to be other-than-temporary. The decrease is also due to lower average cash balances, offset in part by slightly higher interest rates during 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007 and 2006, the average month-end cash balances were approximately $25,324,200 and $45,468,900, respectively. The average effective interest rates during 2007 and 2006 were approximately 5.14% and 4.81%, respectively. 51 Provision for Income Taxes The $40 million milestone payment received from PRF during the first quarter of 2006 resulted in taxable income for the Company. The regular taxable income generated by this transaction has been fully offset with available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company recorded a provision of $372,000 in the first quarter of 2006 for the alternative minimum tax that was estimated to result from receipt of this milestone. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the estimated provision was adjusted to $120,000. In the third quarter of 2007, AVANT made an adjustment to its estimated tax provision estimates of $120,000. Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared with Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2005 AVANT reported a net loss of $20,373,932, or $3.29 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $2,277,363, or 12.6%, compared to a net loss of $18,096,569, or $2.93 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net loss between periods was due to increased operating expenses, offset partially by increased revenues, investment and other income. The weighted average common shares outstanding used to calculate the net loss per common share was 6,184,704 in 2006 and 6,178,621 in 2005 after adjustment for a reverse stock split of 1-for 12. Revenue Total revenue increased $1,842,756, or 59.7%, to $4,931,097 in 2006 from $3,088,341 in 2005. Product development and licensing revenue increased $2,613,174 to $2,855,266 in 2006 from $242,092 in 2005. In February 2006, the European Commission granted approval of Rotarix® in the European Union, which triggered a one-time $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo, 50% of which was creditable against future royalties. Product development and licensing revenue of $2.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2006 and the remaining $1.4 million was remitted to PRF in accordance with the PRF agreement. In the first quarter of 2006, AVANT recognized $550,803 in product royalty revenue related to PRF's purchased interests in the net royalties that AVANT receives from Rotarix® worldwide net sales. AVANT received a number of subcontracts from DVC to develop anthrax and plague vaccines for the U.S. Department of Defense. We were reimbursed by DVC on a time and materials basis for vaccine development research work performed by us. AVANT terminated its arrangements with DVC in the third quarter of 2007. Under these agreements and several SBIR grants, AVANT recognized $1,408,434 and $2,719,651 in government contract and grant revenue during 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in government contract and grant revenue in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily represents a decrease in the level of research work billable to DVC. In 2002, AVANT transferred the marketing and distribution of the Megan poultry product line to its partner, LAHI. Product royalty payments received by AVANT for Megan®Vac 1 and Megan®Egg product sales in 2006 and 2005 totaled $116,594 and $126,598, respectively. Operating Expense Total operating expense increased $5,344,998, or 24.3%, to $27,298,356 in 2006 compared to $21,953,358 in 2005. The increase in total operating expense in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to increased research and development expenses as a result of increased R&D personnel and related expenses, non-personnel operating and facility-related costs associated with a full year of operations of the Fall River facility and increased general and administrative expenses. Research and development expense increased $4,003,097, or 28.5%, to $18,066,392 in 2006 compared to $14,063,295 in 2005. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to $600,000 of license fee expense recorded in the first quarter of 2006 for amounts which will be payable to CCH 52 in connection with Glaxo's 2006 milestone payment. AVANT also experienced increases in research and development personnel and related costs of $1,883,416, consultant fees of $130,452, contract research costs of $354,856, other license fees of $148,566, contract manufacturing costs of $697,915 and non-personnel operating and facility-related costs of $1,143,906 associated with operations of the Fall River facility in 2006 compared to 2005. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in clinical trials costs of $1,552,123 as a result of the completion of the TP10 Phase 2b female clinical trial in 2005. General and administrative expense increased $1,341,901, or 19.5%, to $8,236,852 in 2006 compared to $6,894,951 in 2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily attributed to increases in stock-based compensation expense of $934,669, professional and consultant fees of $349,999 primarily associated with audit, tax and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, and investor relations expenses of $103,370. These increases are partly offset by a decrease in legal fees of $102,428. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets remained the same at $995,110 in 2006 and $995,112 in 2005. Investment and Other Income, Net Net investment and other income increased $1,344,879 to $2,113,327 in 2006 compared to $768,448 in 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average cash balances during 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006 and 2005, the average month-end cash balances were approximately $45,468,900 and $25,600,800, respectively. The average effective interest rates during 2006 and 2005 were approximately 4.81% and 3.06%, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The $40 million milestone payment received from PRF during the first quarter of 2006 will result in taxable income for AVANT. The regular taxable income generated by this transaction has been fully offset with available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. AVANT recorded a provision of $120,000 in 2006 for the alternative minimum tax that will result from receipt of this milestone. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2007, AVANT's principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $15,657,980 compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 of $40,911,539. AVANT's cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions. At December 31, 2007, all investments were in money market mutual funds. Also, AVANT maintains cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits. AVANT does not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances. The use of AVANT's cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for its employees, facility and facility-related costs for its offices and laboratories, fees paid in connection with preclinical studies, clinical studies, contract manufacturing, laboratory supplies and services, consulting fees, and legal fees. To date, the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from AVANT's collaborative partners, from government entities and from financial institutions such as Paul Royalty Fund ("PRF"). In general, AVANT's sources of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be upfront license payments, payments for the achievement of milestones, product royalty payments, payments under government contracts and grants, funded research and development under collaboration agreements that AVANT may receive and the monetization of future royalty payments by financial institutions such as PRF. The timing of any new collaboration agreements, government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements, contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. 53 Net cash used by operating activities was $19,302,986 in 2007 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $27,000,319 in 2006. The decrease is primarily attributed to the increase in net loss incurred in 2007 compared to 2006, the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.6 million due to timing of payments and the $40 million PRF milestone payment received in the first quarter of 2006. These amounts were offset partly by the decrease in prepaid and other current assets and the increase in deferred rent primarily related to the landlord tenant allowance for the Needham facility renovations project. As of the result of the Merger with Celldex, AVANT expects that cash used in operations will increase in 2008 as the combined company continues to develop its products in clinical trials, contracts for the manufacture of clinical materials, runs its Fall River facility at full operational status, makes license and royalty payments and advances new products into preclinical development. The expected increase in cash used would be partially offset by receipt of anticipated payments under AVANT's government grants and anticipated product royalty and milestone payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,710,816 in 2007 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $9,309,790 in 2006. The decrease is due to decreased investment in property and equipment in 2007 as the Company completed its renovations of the Needham facility. AVANT expects to continue investing in capital expenditures in 2008 as it expands its Fall River facility to accommodate cell culture manufacturing requirements for the current Celldex products. Net cash used in financing activities was $239,757 in 2007 compared to $198,424 in 2006. The increase in cash used in financing activities between years is due to the increase in payments of long-term liabilities. In February 2007, AVANT entered into a research and development partnership with Select Vaccines, a public Australian biotechnology company, focused on the use of Select Vaccines' virus-like particles ("VLPs") as a platform technology for the development of viral vaccines. On November 1, 2007, AVANT notified Select Vaccines that, effective December 31, 2007, AVANT for strategic reasons was exercising its rights to terminate its Collaboration and License Agreement with Select Vaccines. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, AVANT recognized $158,095 for the impairment of its investment in Select Vaccines that was determined to be other-than-temporary. In assessing whether the decline in fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, AVANT has determined that it does not have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the decline was temporary. On April 16, 2007, AVANT initiated restructuring activities to reduce ongoing operational costs, following an extensive review of its operations and cost structure. The restructuring aimed to increase the focus of AVANT's resources upon key programs and core operational capabilities and to lower AVANT's overall cost structure. AVANT is concentrating its focus on building an enhanced portfolio of vaccines for global health and travelers around AVANT's core technologies, as well as its unique development and manufacturing capabilities. AVANT will no longer invest in biodefense research and development activities or further invest in clinical trials for its cardiovascular programs. The restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 30%. AVANT also exited from its St. Louis-based research facility by September 30, 2007, when the lease term expired and moved all essential research activities to its Needham, Massachusetts headquarters. The restructuring charges consisted of severance, payroll tax and extended benefits costs for terminated employees, as well as, salary continuation and retention bonus costs for certain St. Louis employees retained during the transition and closing process for the St. Louis facility. As of December 31, 2007, restructuring charges of $765,204 were recorded, of which $754,877 were recorded as research and development and $10,327 were recorded as general and administrative expense. Of the restructuring charge, $384,116 related to St. Louis benefit arrangements and $381,088 related to Needham and Fall River benefit arrangements. During the year ended December 31, 2007, $600,134 of restructuring costs were paid out and a balance of $165,070 of accrued restructuring costs remained at December 31, 2007. The cash impact of the remaining restructuring costs will be incurred primarily during the first quarter of 2008. 54 AVANT believes that cash inflows from existing collaborations, interest income on invested funds and its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund operations beyond December 31, 2008. The working capital requirements of AVANT are dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the costs associated with research and development programs, preclinical and clinical studies and the scope of collaborative arrangements. The amounts that we actually spend for each purpose may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the results from current and future clinical trials, the timing of any regulatory applications and approvals, and technological developments. Expenditures also will depend on the availability of funding or financings. We will continually evaluate our planned activities and any significant change in our activities or in the assumptions underlying our cash projections referred to above could result in a change to such cash projections. During 2008, AVANT may take steps to raise additional capital including, but not limited to, the licensing of technology programs with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, or the issuance of common stock via private placement and public offering. If we do not raise additional funds in 2008, we may take one or more cost reducing measures, including further delays in some of our preclinical and clinical research and development programs and reduced investment in property and equipment. While we continue to seek capital through a number of means, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and our negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may worsen as we continue to use existing resources. There is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development. On June 27, 2007, AVANT reported that its partner, Glaxo, had filed a marketing application for the Rotarix® vaccine with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the second quarter of 2007. The terms of AVANT's agreement with PRF include a $10 million milestone payment on product launch in the United States, which AVANT now expects to receive in 2008 based on Glaxo's filing. AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes AVANT's contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow 55 in future years. These obligations, commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: Total 2008 2009-2011 2012-2013 Thereafter Contractual obligations: Operating lease obligations $ 18,533,400 $ 1,780,900 $ 5,736,100 $ 4,127,400 $ 6,889,000 Loan payable* 1,313,300 123,600 377,300 228,800 583,600 Note payable* 564,100 162,400 401,700   Licensing obligations 810,000 80,000 240,000 160,000 330,000 Construction contracts 586,800 586,800    Restructuring costs 165,100 165,100    Total contractual obligations $ 21,972,700 $ 2,898,800 $ 6,755,100 $ 4,516,200 $ 7,802,600 Commercial commitments: Clinical development $ 619,600 $ 619,600 $  $  $  Manufacturing development      Total commercial commitments $ 619,600 $ 619,600 $  $  $  *includes interest obligations RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SFAS 157: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of SFAS 157 will change current practice. SFAS 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We have not yet determined the effect if any that adopting SFAS 157 will have on AVANT's financial statements. SFAS 159: In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 155 ("SFAS 159"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on AVANT's financial position and results of operations. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160: In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ("SFAS 141(R)") and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS 160"), which introduce significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. SFAS 141(R) is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption of both Statements is prohibited. We have not yet 56 determined the effect if any that adopting SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will have on AVANT's financial statements. EITF 07-3: In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods and Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities ("EITF 07-3"). EITF 07-3 states that non-refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed. EITF is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. Entities are to recognize the effects of EITF 07-3 prospectively for new contracts entered into after the effective date. The adoption of EITF 07-3 is not expected to have a material impact on AVANT's financial position and results of operations. EITF 07-1: In December 2007, the EITF of the FASB reached a consensus on Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements ("EITF 07-1"). The EITF concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in EITF 99-19 and other accounting literature. Based on the nature of the arrangement, payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and its terms, the nature of the entity's business, and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented. Companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial-statement amounts related to the arrangements. Activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature; however required disclosure under EITF 07-1 applies to the entire collaborative agreement. EITF 07-1 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2007 and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all existing collaborative arrangements. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. None. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations, including our research and development activities. None of these market-risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes. We invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds. These investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio. Our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity. We have implemented investment policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments. Because of the short-term nature of these investments, we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk. The impact to our financial position and results of operations from likely changes in interest rates is not material. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financials Statements for a description of our use of other financial instruments. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables and accounts payable approximates fair value at December 31, 2007 due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 57 Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Page Report of Registered Independent Public Accounting Firm 59 Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 60 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 61 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 62 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 63 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 64 58 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of stockholders' equity (deficit) and of cash flows, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation in 2006. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 18, 2008 59 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (A) Nature of Business and Overview AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. ("AVANT" or "the Company") is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of products that harness the human immune response to prevent and treat disease. AVANT has actively developed and acquired innovative technologiesespecially novel approaches to vaccine creationthat harness the human immune system. The Company develops and commercializes products on a proprietary basis and in collaboration with established pharmaceutical partners and other collaborators, including GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer Inc and Lohmann Animal Health International. On October 22, 2007, AVANT and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. ("Celldex"), a privately-held company, announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger"). On March 7, 2008, AVANT announced the completed Merger of Callisto Merger Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of AVANT, with and into Celldex. The Merger has created a NASDAQ-listed and diversified biopharmaceutical company with a pipeline of product candidates addressing high-value indications including oncology, infectious and inflammatory diseases. AVANT's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 were $15,657,980. Its working capital at December 31, 2007 was $6,579,548. AVANT incurred a loss of $21,638,761 and net cash used in operations of $19,302,986 for the year ended December 31, 2007. AVANT believes that cash inflows from existing grants and collaborations, interest income on invested funds and our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund operations beyond December 31, 2008. The working capital requirements of AVANT are dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the costs associated with research and development programs, pre-clinical and clinical studies, manufacture of clinical materials and the scope of collaborative arrangements. During 2008, AVANT may take steps to raise additional capital including, but not limited to, the licensing of technology programs with existing or new collaborative partners, possible business combinations, or the issuance of common stock via private placement and public offering. If AVANT does not raise additional funds in 2008, AVANT may take one or more cost reducing measures, including further delays in some of the preclinical and clinical research and development programs and reduced investment in property and equipment. While we continue to seek capital through a number of means, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and AVANT's negotiating position in capital-raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used. There is also no assurance that AVANT will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to AVANT's stockholders; debt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict AVANT's ability to operate as a business; and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce AVANT's economic potential from products under development. Rotarix® is now licensed in over 70 countries worldwide in addition to the European Union market. GlaxoSmithkline ("Glaxo") filed a Biologics License Application ("BLA") with the US Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for United States market approval in 2007. On February 20, 2008, Rotarix® received a favorable recommendation from the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The committee's favorable recommendation, although not binding, will be considered by the FDA in its review of the BLA for the candidate vaccine, which is currently underway. U.S. approval triggers a $1.5 million milestone payment to AVANT from Glaxo, $750,000 of which AVANT will retain under AVANT's agreement with Paul Royalty Fund ("PRF"). The market 64 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) launch of Rotarix® by Glaxo in the U.S. market would result in a $10 million milestone payment to AVANT from PRF, which AVANT expects in the second half of 2008. (B) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Megan Health, Inc. ("Megan") and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Callisto Merger Corporation ("Celldex")). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. (C) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. At December 31, 2007, all investments were in money market mutual funds. Investments in marketable securities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". There were no outstanding investments in marketable securities at December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2007, AVANT had an investment with a fair value of $646,989 in the stock of Select Vaccines. AVANT may invest its cash in debt instruments of financial institutions, government entities and corporations, and mutual funds. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification and maturities to mitigate risk and maintain liquidity. (D) Fair Value of Financial Instruments AVANT enters into various types of financial instruments in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of AVANT's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of long-term liabilities is discussed in Note 10. (E) Revenue Recognition AVANT has entered into various license and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The terms of the agreements typically include non-refundable license fees, funding of research and development, payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales. Non-refundable license fees are recognized as contract and license fee revenue when AVANT has a contractual right to receive such payments, provided a contractual arrangement exists, the contract price is fixed or determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and AVANT has no further performance obligations under the license agreement. When AVANT has performance obligations under the terms of a contact, non-refundable fees are recognized as revenue as AVANT completes its obligations. Where AVANT's level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. Revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned, as determined using the straight-line basis, as of the period ending date. The determination of the performance period involves judgment on management's part. Funding of research and development is recognized over the term of the applicable contract as costs are incurred related to that contract. 65 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone. Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone; and, the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as AVANT completes its performance obligations. Revenues from government contracts and grants are recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the government. Product royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize AVANT's licensed technologies and are recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement. Payments received in advance of activities being performed are recorded as deferred revenue. Any significant changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact our revenue recognition. Product royalties related to the sale of a royalty interest on the worldwide sales of Rotarix® to PRF is recognized as revenue in accordance with the guidance in EITF 88-18 "Sale of Future Revenues". Upfront unconditional and contingent payments for which the contingencies have been achieved have been recorded by AVANT as deferred revenue. Revenues will be recognized and calculated based on the ratio of total royalties received from Glaxo and remitted to PRF over expected total amounts to be received by PRF and then applying this percentage to the total cumulative consideration received from PRF to date. The expected total of payments to be paid to PRF is an estimate which AVANT will update from time to time to determine that the estimate continues to be reasonable in the light of then current events and circumstances. Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted EITF 00-21, Accounting For Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement. The criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the customer's right of return for the delivered item. (F) Research and Development Costs Research and development costs, including internal and contract research costs, are expensed as incurred. (G) Trade and Other Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. AVANT has not historically experienced credit losses from its trade accounts receivable and therefore have not established an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. 66 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Accounts and other receivables consist of the following: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Trade Receivables $ 5,957 $ 183,830 Other Receivables 325,715 137,111 $ 331,672 $ 320,941 Other receivables at December 31, 2007 represent interest receivable from a bank and a receivable of $297,500 from the sale of equipment. Other receivables at December 31, 2006 represent interest receivable from a bank. (H) Long-Lived Assets: In the ordinary course of our business, we incur substantial costs to construct property and equipment. The treatment of costs to construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction. Costs incurred in the project planning and design phase, and in the construction and installation phase, are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. We stop capitalizing costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. For manufacturing property and equipment, we also capitalize the cost of validating these assets for the underlying manufacturing process. We complete the capitalization of validation costs when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Costs capitalized include incremental labor and fringe benefits, and direct consultancy services. Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Laboratory equipment and office furniture and equipment are depreciated over a five year period and computer equipment is depreciated over a three year period. Manufacturing equipment is amortized over a seven to ten year period. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the noncancelable term of the related lease, including any renewals that are reasonably assured of occurring. Property and equipment under construction is classified as construction in progress and is depreciated or amortized only after the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense whereas the costs of significant improvements which extend the life of the underlying asset are capitalized. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the related gains or losses are reflected in net income. (I) Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for potential impairment under SFAS No. 144. We perform these evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include: a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used; a significant decrease in the market value of an asset; a significant adverse change in its business or the industry in which it is sold; and a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset. 67 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) If we believe an indicator of potential impairment exists, we test to determine whether impairment recognition criteria in SFAS No. 144 have been met. We charge impairments of the long-lived assets to operations if our evaluations indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable. (J) Accounting for Patent Costs: Patent costs are expensed as incurred. Certain patent costs are reimbursed by our product development and licensing partners. Any reimbursed patent costs are recorded as product development and licensing agreement revenues in our financial statements. (K) Interest Capitalization AVANT capitalizes interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring certain assets during the period of time required to get the asset ready for its intended use. The amount of capitalized interest is limited to the amount of interest incurred by AVANT. In 2007 and 2006, AVANT capitalized interest costs of $54,396 and $92,240, respectively, incurred in financing leasehold improvements and laboratory and manufacturing equipment at its Needham and Fall River facilities. The total amount of interest costs incurred by AVANT in 2007 and 2006 were $90,362 and $102,720, respectively. (L) Operating Leases The Company presently has two facilities which are located at Needham and Fall River, Massachusetts under non-cancellable operating lease agreements for office, laboratory and manufacturing space. Effective September 30, 2007, AVANT closed its operations in Overland, Missouri. The rent payments for the two locations escalate over the lease term. The Company expenses its obligations under these lease agreements on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease, including any renewals that are reasonably assured of occurring. (M) Intangible Assets AVANT has acquired intangible assets, which include core technology, developed technology and a strategic partner agreement, through the acquisition of Megan and UPT. These acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives which range from 5 to 17 years. The determination of the amortization period involves estimates and judgments on management's part. Any significant changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact the carrying value of acquired intangible assets. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets when facts and circumstances suggest the asset could be impaired in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets". (N) Loss Per Share AVANT computes and reports earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share". The computations of basic and diluted loss per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. Options and warrants to purchase 356,264, 310,665 and 284,950 shares of common stock and Restricted Stock Units totaling 0, 0, and 83,333 shares were not included in the 2007, 2006 and 2005 computation of diluted net loss per share, respectively, because inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share. In 2007 and 2006, restricted stock units totaling 83,333 shares were 68 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as they were deemed contingently issuable shares. Share amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheets and share amounts and basic and diluted net loss per share amounts shown on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss have been adjusted to reflect a reverse stock split of 1-for-12 effective March 7, 2008. (O) Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is comprised of two components, net loss and other comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2007, AVANT recorded other comprehensive income of $70,084 related to unrealized gains in its investment in Select Vaccines Limited. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, AVANT had no other comprehensive income. (P) Foreign Currency Transactions Expenses incurred in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains and losses from foreign currency translations are included in investment and other income, net in the statements of operations. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, AVANT recorded foreign currency transaction losses of $7,743, $49,956 and $2,223, respectively. (Q) Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," ("SFAS 123(R)") which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("employee stock purchases") based on estimated fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") relating to SFAS 123(R). The Company has also applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 as allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Under the intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations because the exercise price of the Company's stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and compensation expense for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). In conjunction with the adoption of 69 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) SFAS 123(R), compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 will continue to be recognized using the straight-line method and compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006 will also be recognized using the straight-line method. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the Company's pro forma information required under SFAS 123 for the periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company retained its method of valuation for share-based awards granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model ("Black-Scholes model") which was previously used for the Company's pro forma information required under SFAS 123. The Company's determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. See Note 5 for additional information. (R) Restructuring Activities In accordance with SFAS No. 146, the Company recognizes a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity and measures the amount of liability at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. (S) Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (T) Segments Management uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. For this reason, AVANT has determined that it is engaged in one industry segment. Substantially all of AVANT's revenue since inception has been generated in the United States and all of our assets are in the United States. (U) Recent Pronouncements SFAS 157: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the Board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of SFAS 157 will change current practice. SFAS 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 70 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We have not yet determined the effect if any that adopting SFAS 157 will have on the Company's financial statements. SFAS 159: In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilitiesincluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 155 ("SFAS 159"), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on AVANT's financial position and results of operations. SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160: In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ("SFAS 141(R)") and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS 160"), which introduce significant changes in the accounting for and reporting of business acquisitions and noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. SFAS 141(R) is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption of both Statements is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect if any that adopting SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 will have on the Company's financial statements. EITF 07-3: In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on EITF Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods and Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities ("EITF 07-3"). EITF 07-3 states that non-refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed. EITF is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. Entities are to recognize the effects of EITF 07-3 prospectively for new contracts entered into after the effective date. The adoption of EITF 07-3 is not expected to have a material impact on AVANT's financial position and results of operations. EITF 07-1: In December 2007, the EITF of the FASB reached a consensus on Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements ("EITF 07-1"). The EITF concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in EITF 99-19 and other accounting literature. Based on the nature of the arrangement, payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and its terms, the nature of the entity's business, and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented. Companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial-statement amounts related to the arrangements. Activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature; however required disclosure under EITF 07-1 applies to the entire collaborative agreement. EITF 07-1 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2007 and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all existing collaborative arrangements. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 71 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

AVANT recorded a loss of $478,286 on disposal of fixed assets during 2007. AVANT recorded a gain on disposal of other fixed assets of $14,854 in 2006. Depreciation expense related to equipment and leasehold improvements was approximately $1,727,153, $1,100,349 and $596,547 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 3. GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS Goodwill: AVANT has concluded that it currently has one reporting unit and has assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit for purposes of performing its annual impairment test in accordance with SFAS 142. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using AVANT's market capitalization as of July 1, 2007 and 2006, adjusted for a control premium. The fair value on July 1, 2007 and 2006 exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Accordingly, AVANT concluded that no impairment existed as of these dates.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS (Continued) All of AVANT's intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Total amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $960,212, $995,110 and $995,112, respectively. The estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets as of December 31, 2007 and for the five succeeding years is as follows: Year ending December 31, Estimated Amortization Expense 2008 $ 529,512 2009 529,512 2010 514,622 2011 350,822 2012 350,782 4. ACCRUED EXPENSES Accrued expenses are comprised of amounts owed to employees, vendors, and suppliers for work performed on behalf of us. At each period end the Company evaluates the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated. Such estimates are subject to changes as additional information becomes available. Accrued expenses include the following: December 31, 2007 December 31, 2006 Accrued License Fees $ 368,804 $ 416,122 Accrued Payroll and Employee Benefits 657,408 678,459 Accrued Clinical Trials 270,765 263,220 Accrued Manufacturing Expenses  281,035 Accrued Professional Fees 320,322 131,413 Accrued Restructuring Expenses 153,726  Accrued Facility Renovation Expenses 547,246 667,124 Other Accrued Expenses 827,381 237,171 $ 3,145,652 $ 2,674,544 5.

In addition, all references to each outstanding option to purchase shares of AVANT common stock under the 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested, terminated under their terms on March 7, 2008 in connection with the consummation of the Merger and such options are of no further force and effect. 73 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 5. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) Restricted Stock Unit Awards In September 2005, November 2004 and September 2003, the Company awarded restricted stock units to Dr. Una Ryan, its President and CEO, and determined the value of the restricted stock unit awards to be $270,000, $832,000 and $1,104,000, respectively, based on the closing price of AVANT's common stock on the award date. The value of the restricted stock units was amortized over the remaining months until Dr. Ryan attained age 65 in December 2006, and was recorded as compensation expense. In connection with the award, the Company has recognized $0, $1,225,000 and $538,000 as stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2004 Plan") was adopted on May 13, 2004. All full time employees of AVANT are eligible to participate in the 2004 Plan. A total of 150,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, each participating employee may contribute up to 15% of his or her compensation to purchase up to 500 shares of common stock per year in any six-month offering period and may withdraw from the offering at any time before stock is purchased. Participation terminates automatically upon termination of employment. The purchase price per share of common stock in an offering is 85% of the lower of its fair market value at either the beginning of the offering period or the applicable exercise date. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued 5,518 and 11,592 shares, respectively, under the 2004 Plan. Shares purchased under the plan are issued in the month following the end of each offering period. At December 31, 2007, 121,239 shares were available for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan is a compensatory plan under SFAS 123R. The requisite service period for compensation cost resulting from the 2004 Plan is the period over which the employee participates in the plan and pays for the shares. AVANT has historically established two purchase periods during each yearJanuary 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31. The requisite service period begins on the enrollment date (the start of the offering period) and ends on the purchase date and is determined to be six months. Employee Stock Option Plans Stock Option Plan Description On May 6, 1999, AVANT's 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "1999 Plan") was adopted. The 1999 Plan replaced the Amended and Restated 1991 Stock Compensation Plan, which was an amendment and restatement of AVANT's 1985 Incentive Option Plan. The 1999 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options (intended to qualify as such under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock and other awards of restricted stock in lieu of cash bonuses to employees, consultants and outside directors. The 1999 Plan, as amended in 2002, allows for a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of common stock to be issued prior to May 6, 2009. The Board of Directors determines the term of each option, option price, and number of shares for which each option is granted and the rate at which each option vests. 74 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 5. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The Board of Directors has granted employee stock option awards with four-year vesting periods. The term of each option cannot exceed ten years (five years for options granted to holders of more than 10% of the voting stock of AVANT) and the exercise price of stock options cannot be less than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant (110% of fair market value for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the voting stock of AVANT). Vesting of all employee stock option awards is accelerated upon a change in control as defined in the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. Each non-employee director who is serving as a director of the Company on the fifth business day after each annual meeting of stockholders will automatically be granted on such day a non-qualified stock option to acquire 10,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price of each such non-qualified stock option is the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant. Each such non-qualified stock option is exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date. Such non-qualified stock options will expire ten years from the date of grant. The 1999 Plan also provides for discretionary grants of non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. Vesting of all non-employee director stock option awards is accelerated upon a change in control as defined in the 1999 Plan. On November 17, 2005, pursuant to and in accordance with the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of AVANT approved full acceleration of the vesting of otherwise unvested stock options that had an exercise price of $2.00 or greater granted under the 1999 Plan that were held by employees, officers and non-employee directors. As a result of the Board of Directors' action, a total of 265,935 of such "out-of-the-money" unvested stock options, having a weighted average exercise price of $2.37 per share, became exercisable effective November 17, 2005, rather than the later dates when such options would have vested in the normal course. The Company determined the value of the "out-of-the-money" unvested stock options to be $360,100. This action was taken in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 1999 Plan. The Board's decision to accelerate the vesting of these "out-of-the-money" stock options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that otherwise would be recorded in future periods following AVANT's adoption in the first quarter of 2006 of SFAS 123R. 75 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

Based on basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 6,265,504 for 2007 and 6,184,704 for 2006 after adjustment for a reverse stock split of 1-for-12. The effect of stock-based compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R for fiscal 2007 and 2006 on earnings per share was $0.06 and $0.26, respectively. 77 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 5. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The table below reflects the pro forma information for the years ended December 31, 2005 as follows: 2005 Net Loss: As reported $ 18,096,569 Less: Stock-based employee compensation expense as reported (538,000 ) Add: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards 1,329,300 Pro forma $ 18,887,869 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share(1): As reported $ 2.93 Pro forma $ 3.06 (1)Adjusted to reflect a reverse stock split of 1-for-12 effective March 7, 2008. The total fair value of stock options vested during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $408,827. As of December 31, 2007, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized was $641,540, net of estimated forfeitures, which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of 1.73 years. The fair values of employee stock options granted were valued using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Expected stock price volatility (employees) 7374 % 7685 % 8085 % Expected stock price volatility (non-employee directors) 6173 % 7680 % 8085 % Expected option term (employees) 6.25 Years 6.25 Years 4.55 Years Expected option term (non-employee directors) 5.5 Years 5.5 Years 4.55 Years Risk-free interest rate 3.25.2 % 4.35.2 % 3.64.6 % Expected dividend yield None None None The Company used its daily historical stock price volatility consistent with the expected term of grant as the basis for its expected volatility assumption in accordance with SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107 for its employee and non-employee director stock options and employee stock purchases. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company had also used its daily historical stock price volatility in accordance with SFAS 123 for purposes of its pro forma information. The Company has assessed that its historical volatility is representative of expected future stock price trends. 78 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 5. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the Company's employee and non-employee director stock options and employee stock purchases. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's history of zero dividend payouts and expectation that no dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. The Company has elected to follow the guidance of SAB 107 and adopt this simplified method in determining the expected term for its stock option awards. There were 80,000 stock option grants to non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company has not recognized any tax benefits or deductions related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation as the Company carries a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance and has significant net operating loss carryforwards available. 6. INCOME TAXES The $40 million milestone payment received from Paul Royalty Fund II, L.P. ("PRF") during the first quarter of 2006 resulted in taxable income for the Company. The regular taxable income generated by this transaction was fully offset against available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company recorded a provision of $372,000 in the first quarter of 2006 for the alternative minimum tax that was estimated to result from receipt of this milestone. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the estimated provision was adjusted to $120,000. In the third quarter of 2007, AVANT made an adjustment to its tax provision estimates of $120,000 after determining that no alternative minimum tax will be due on the transaction. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement 109 ("FIN 48"). This statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company's financial statements. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007. The implementation of FIN No. 48 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash flows. At the adoption date of January 1, 2007, and also at December 31, 2007, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has not, as yet, conducted a study of its research and development credit carryforwards. This study may result in an adjustment to the Company's research and development credit carryforwards, however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position under FIN 48. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company's research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance. Thus, there would be no impact to the consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations if an adjustment were required. As of December 31, 2007, AVANT had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $158,897,000 and $8,675,000, respectively, and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of approximately $29,989,000 and $5,801,000, respectively, which may be available to offset future federal and state income tax liabilities and that expire at various dates from 2008 through 2027. Utilization of the net operating loss ("NOL") and research and development ("R&D") credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by Section 382 of the Internal 79 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 6. INCOME TAXES (Continued) Revenue Code of 1986, as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. Since the Company's formation, the Company has raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both pre and post initial public offering) which, combined with the purchasing shareholders' subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in a change of control, as defined by Section 382, or could result in a change of control in the future upon subsequent disposition. The Company has completed a study to assess whether changes of control have occurred which would limit the Company's utilization of its NOL or R&D credit carryforwards. Based on this study, management has preliminarily concluded that there are no significant limitations. The Company does not expect to have taxable income for the foreseeable future. AVANT believes its Merger with Celldex may generate an ownership change that could further affect the limitation in future years. Massachusetts and Missouri are the two states in which the Company has operated and has income tax nexus. Open federal and state return years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include the tax years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006. Carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2004 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS if they either have been or will be used in a future period. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdictions for any tax years. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There have been no interest or penalties recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet as a result of FIN 48 calculations. The Company has not recorded any interest and penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits since its inception.

Management has determined that it is more likely than not that AVANT will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and, as a result, a valuation allowance of approximately $107,062,000 has been established at December 31, 2007. The future realization, if any, of the deferred tax assets attributable to disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and the exercise of nonqualified stock options 81 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

INCOME TAXES (Continued) will not be recognized as a tax benefit in the statement of operations, but rather as a component of stockholders' equity. 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (A) Public and Private Stock Offerings AVANT filed a shelf registration statement in May 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register for sale any combination of securities described in the filing up to a dollar amount of $40 million. At December 31, 2007, no securities had been sold by the Company from this shelf registration. (B) Preferred Stock At December 31, 2007 and 2006, AVANT had authorized preferred stock comprised of 96,925 shares of convertible Class B and 3,000,000 shares of convertible Class C of which 350,000 shares has been designated as Class C-1 Junior Participating Cumulative, the terms of which are to be determined by our Board of Directors. There was no preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006. (C) Warrants AVANT has issued warrants to purchase common stock in connection with the private placement of approximately 370,370 shares in July 2003. The warrants are exercisable at $36.00 per share and expire July 1, 2008. Warrants outstanding at December 31, 2007, after adjustment for a reverse stock split of 1-for-12 effective March 7, 2008, are as follows: Security Number of Shares Exercise Price Per Share Expiration Date Common stock 37,037 $ 36.00 July 1, 2008 In connection with the acquisition of VRI in August 1998, AVANT assumed the obligations of VRI with respect to each outstanding warrant to purchase VRI common stock (a "VRI Warrant"). The last of the VRI Warrants expired on December 14, 2005. In 2005, 1,861 warrants were exercised as cashless exercises resulting in the issuance of 536 shares. (D) Shareholder Rights Plan On November 5, 2004, AVANT's Board adopted a new Shareholder Rights Plan, as set forth in the Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated November 5, 2004, between the Company and Computer Investor Services, LLC (formerly EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.), as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"). The Rights Agreement replaces the Company's existing Shareholder Rights Agreement which expired on November 10, 2004. Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right for each outstanding share of AVANT's common stock. These rights, which expire in November 2014, entitle their holders to purchase from AVANT one ten-thousandth of a share (a "Unit") of Series C-1 Junior Participating 82 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, ("C-1 Preferred Stock") at a cash exercise price of $35.00 per Unit, subject to adjustment. The rights will trade separately from the common stock and will become exercisable only when a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding common stock or upon the commencement by a person or group of a tender offer that would result in such person or group acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding common stock other than as a result of repurchases of stock by AVANT or certain inadvertent actions by a shareholder. In the event a person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock each holder of a right (except for any such person or group) would be entitled to receive upon exercise sufficient Units of C-1 Preferred Stock to equal a value of two times the exercise price of the purchase right. In the event AVANT is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or if 50% or more of AVANT's assets or earning power is sold, each holder of a right (except for any such person or group described above) would receive upon exercise common stock of the acquiring company with a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has authorized the issuance of 350,000 shares of C-1 Preferred Stock for use in connection with the shareholder rights plan. (E) Share Repurchase Plan On August 16, 2002, AVANT announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 2 million shares of its common stock. The repurchased stock provides AVANT with treasury shares for general corporate purposes, such as stock to be issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The share repurchase plan expired as of August 31, 2003. AVANT purchased 220,300 shares (18,358 shares after adjustment for a reverse stock split of 1-for-12 effective March 7, 2008) through December 31, 2003 at a cost of $227,600. No shares were purchased in 2007 or 2006. (F) Merger with Celldex At the special meeting of AVANT shareholders held on March 6, 2008 in connection with the Merger (as described in Note 1), stockholders approved four proposals: (i) the issuance of shares of AVANT common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement in the amount necessary to result in the Celldex stockholders owning 58% of AVANT common stock on a fully diluted basis, (ii) an amendment to AVANT's Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares to 300,000,000, (iii) an amendment to AVANT's Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split in a ratio ranging from one-for-twelve to one-for-twenty of all the issued and outstanding shares of AVANT common stock, the final ratio to be determined within the discretion of the AVANT board of directors and (iv) adoption of the 2008 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. AVANT's board of directors approved a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of AVANT's common stock, which became effective on, March 7, 2008. As a result of the reverse stock split, each twelve shares of common stock will be combined and reclassified into one share of common stock and the total number of shares outstanding will be reduced from approximately 180 million shares (including the shares issued to Celldex stockholders in the merger) to approximately 15 million shares. Also, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Celldex shareholders received 4.96 shares of common stock in exchange for each share of Celldex common stock and Class A common stock they 83 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued) own. AVANT stockholders retained 42% of, and the former Celldex stockholders now own 58% of, the outstanding shares of AVANT's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. AVANT also assumed all of Celldex's stock options outstanding at the time of the Merger. 8. RESEARCH AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS AVANT has entered into licensing agreements with several universities and research organizations. Under the terms of these agreements, we have received licenses or options to license technology, specified patents or patent applications. AVANT has expensed nonrefundable license fees of approximately $110,000, $85,000 and $85,000 in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 9. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS Our revenue from product development and licensing agreements was received pursuant to contracts with different organizations. Total revenue recognized by us in connection with these contracts for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $125,039, $2,855,266 and $242,092, respectively. A summary of these contracts follows: (A) GlaxoSmithKline plc ("Glaxo") and Paul Royalty Fund ("PRF") In 1997, AVANT entered into an agreement with Glaxo to collaborate on the development and commercialization of the Company's oral rotavirus vaccine and Glaxo assumed responsibility for all subsequent clinical trials and all other development activities. AVANT licensed-in the Rotarix® technology in 1995 and owes a license fee of 30% to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center ("CCH") on net royalties received from Glaxo. AVANT is obligated to maintain a license with CCH with respect to the Glaxo agreement. All licensing fees are included in research and development expense. The term of the Glaxo agreement is through the expiration of the last of the relevant patents covered by the agreement, although Glaxo may terminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. In May 2005, AVANT entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of Paul Royalty Fund II, L.P. ("PRF") purchased an interest in the net royalties AVANT will receive on worldwide sales of Rotarix®. Under the PRF agreement, AVANT will retain 50% of future Glaxo milestone payments beginning on the effective date of the agreement with PRF, with 70% of the remaining balance payable to PRF and 30% of the remaining balance payable to CCH, respectively. The PRF agreement also provides for a $10 million milestone payment to AVANT if Rotarix® is launched in the United States in 2008. AVANT expects to achieve this milestone in the second half of 2008. The PRF transaction qualifies as a sale in accordance with guidance in EITF 88-18, "Sale of Future Revenues." The upfront unconditional payment of $10 million and the $40 million milestone payment for launch in the European Union were recorded by AVANT as deferred revenue upon receipt. Any future milestone payments received from PRF will also be recorded as deferred revenue. Revenues are being recognized and calculated based on the ratio of total royalties received from Glaxo and remitted to PRF over expected total amounts to be received by PRF and then applying this percentage to the total cumulative consideration received from PRF to date. The expected total of payments to PRF is an estimate which will be updated for any changes in expectations of such payments. The impact of any such changes will be applied prospectively. 84 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 9. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS (Continued) In February 2006, the European Commission granted approval of Rotarix® in the European Union, which triggered a $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo, 50% of which is creditable against future royalties. Revenue of $2.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2006 as AVANT has no continuing obligations to incur any research and development costs in connection with the Glaxo agreement. Glaxo has agreed to make further payments, which could total up to $1.5 million, upon achievement of a specific milestone. In 2006, AVANT also recorded $600,000 in royalty expense payable to CCH as a result of the $4 million milestone payment from Glaxo. AVANT remitted the remaining $1.4 million of the Glaxo milestone payment to PRF in accordance with the PRF agreement. As a result, in 2006, AVANT also recognized $550,803 in product royalty revenue related to PRF's purchased interests in the net royalties that AVANT receives from Rotarix® worldwide net sales. In 2007, AVANT recognized $4,370,621 in Rotarix®-related product royalty revenue consisting of $2,334,382 related to PRF's purchased interest in Rotarix® net royalties and $2,036,239 related to AVANT's retained interest in Rotarix® net royalties which were not sold to PRF, which also corresponds to the amount payable by AVANT to CCH. As such, a corresponding amount is recorded as royalty expense and included in research and development expense. Based on management's best estimates of the amount and timing of Glaxo royalties, the Company has classified $4,844,384 and $42,270,431 of the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2007 as short-term and long-term, respectively. In September 2006, AVANT received notice from Glaxo that Glaxo would begin paying royalties on sales of Rotarix® vaccine at the lower of two royalty rates under their 1997 license agreement. Glaxo's decision to pay the lower royalty rate (which is 70% of the full rate) is based upon Glaxo's assertion that Rotarix ® is not covered by the patents Glaxo licensed from AVANT in Australia and certain European countries. AVANT is determined to take all available steps to enforce its rights under its license agreement with Glaxo. AVANT has recognized royalty revenue at the lower rates and will continue to do so until the dispute with Glaxo is resolved. (B) Pfizer Inc ("Pfizer") In connection with the Company's acquisition of Megan in 2000, it entered into a licensing agreement with Pfizer's Animal Health Division whereby Pfizer has licensed Megan's technology for the development of animal health and food safety vaccines. Under the agreement, AVANT may receive additional milestone payments of up to $3 million based upon attainment of specified milestones. AVANT may receive royalty payments on eventual product sales. The term of this agreement is through the expiration of the last of the patents covered by the agreement. AVANT has no obligation to incur any research and development costs in connection with this agreement. As of June 1, 2006, AVANT entered into a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with Pfizer aimed at the discovery and development of vaccines to protect animals. In 2007, further funded work at AVANT on the joint research program was terminated by Pfizer after AVANT provided two of four deliverables to Pfizer. AVANT recognized $62,500 and $137,500 in product development revenue from Pfizer, Inc for years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 85 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 9. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS (Continued) (C) DVC LLC ("DVC", formerly DynPort Vaccine Company LLC) In October 2001, the Company granted DVC a license for exclusive rights to use certain components of its anthrax vaccine technology. Under the agreement, AVANT was entitled to annual $50,000 license maintenance payments, with respect to which AVANT had received $200,000 in the aggregate, including $50,000 received in the first quarter of 2005, and milestone payments of up to $700,000 in the aggregate, $100,000 of which AVANT recognized as revenue in 2002. The annual license fee was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the year. On August 5, 2005, AVANT received notice from DVC of termination of the license agreement, effective November 5, 2005. In January 2003, AVANT was awarded a subcontract by DVC in the amount of $2.5 million to develop for the U.S. Department of Defense an oral combination vaccine against anthrax and plague using AVANT's proprietary vaccine technologies. As of December 31, 2007, AVANT had received a number of additional subcontract modifications from DVC to support further development and pre-clinical animal testing of vaccine constructs of anthrax and plague vaccine candidates. Total contract funding awarded by DVC totaled approximately $12 million. Payments under the subcontract agreement were made on a time and materials basis and receipt of the full amount was conditioned upon the project being fully funded through completion and AVANT performing and continuing to demonstrate that it has the capability to perform the funded work. As a result of AVANT's restructuring in April 2007, the Company discontinued investing its resources in biodefense research and development activities. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, AVANT recognized $250,491, $1,157,381 and $2,408,936, respectively, in government contract revenue from DVC. Through December 31, 2007, AVANT had received approximately $9.7 million in payments under the various subcontract agreements, all of which related to approved subcontract awards. These agreements expired in 2007. (D) Inflazyme Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ("Inflazyme", formerly AdProTech, Ltd ("AdProTech")) In March 2004, AVANT granted a license to AdProTech for non-exclusive rights to use certain components of its intellectual property surrounding complement inhibition. In April 2004, AVANT received an initial license payment of $1 million from AdProTech and AdProTech was acquired by Inflazyme, which assumed the license. AVANT has no continuing involvement or obligation under this license agreement, thus it recognized the $1 million as revenue during the first quarter of 2004. Under the agreement, AVANT is entitled to annual license fees, milestone payments of up to $13.5 million in the aggregate and royalties on eventual product sales. AVANT has no obligations to incur any research and development costs in connection with this agreement. (E) Select Vaccines Limited ("Select Vaccines") In February 2007, AVANT entered into a research and development partnership with Select Vaccines, a public Australian biotechnology company, focused on the use of Select Vaccines' virus-like particles ("VLPs") as a platform technology for the development of viral vaccines. Research and development efforts initially targeted the development of vaccines against influenza, including both epidemic and pandemic forms of vaccine. Under the terms of the agreement, AVANT made an upfront equity investment of $735,000 in Select Vaccines and would fund influenza vaccine research and development for two years, as well as provide payments to Select Vaccines for the achievement of 86 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

On November 1, 2007, AVANT notified Select Vaccines that, effective December 31, 2007, AVANT for strategic reasons was exercising its rights to terminate its Collaboration and License Agreement with Select Vaccines. AVANT has classified its equity investment in Select Vaccines shares as available for sale securities under FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, ("FAS 115"). In accordance with FAS115, all available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are reported in other income (expense). During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, AVANT recognized $158,095 for the impairment of its investment in Select Vaccines that was determined to be other-than-temporary. In assessing whether the decline in fair value of the investment was other-than-temporary, AVANT has determined that it did not have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the decline was temporary. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, AVANT recorded other comprehensive income of $70,084 related to unrealized gains in its investment in Select Vaccines. 10.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (A) Commitments for the Renovations of the Needham Facility In November 2005, AVANT entered into a lease amendment which extended its lease of laboratory and office space in Needham, Massachusetts through April, 2017. The lease amendment called for the complete renovation of the Needham facility by the landlord and reduced AVANT's leased space to approximately 35,200 square feet. The projected costs for the tenant improvements portion of the renovations project are approximately $9.4 million. As an incentive for AVANT to enter into the lease amendment, the landlord agreed to contribute $3.6 million towards tenant improvement costs. The Company will record the full cost of the Needham renovation project as an asset and the amounts of 88 AVANT IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) landlord incentive will be recorded as deferred rent (included under "Other Long-Term Liabilities" account in the consolidated balance sheets) in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin 88-1 "Issues Related to Accounting for Leases." Amortization of the deferred rent will be recorded as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term when the renovation project is complete and will be classified as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. AVANT has recorded a total of $3,600,000 in deferred rent related to the Needham landlord's tenant incentive allowance. In May 2007, AVANT began amortizing on a straight-line basis the tenant incentive allowance over the ten-year lease term and recorded a reduction in rent expense of $240,000 in the year ended December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, deferred rent of $3,360,000 related to the Needham landlord's tenant incentive allowance was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of which $360,000 is classified as current and $3,000,000 as long-term other liabilities. As of December 31, 2007, AVANT had made payments and accrued costs totaling approximately $9,411,217 towards the tenant improvements portion of the renovations project of which $547,246 remains unpaid as of December 31, 2007. Under this lease amendment, AVANT is obligated to pay an escalating base annual rent ranging from $879,700 to $1,161,200 during the extension term. Aggregate rental payments including common area maintenance costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 for this facility were $1,911,088 and $2,274,738, respectively.

The lease has an initial seven-year term which expires in December 2010 and two renewal options of five years each. Management has determined that it is reasonably assured that AVANT will exercise one five-year renewal option. Therefore, AVANT is amortizing leasehold improvements made to the Fall River facility over the original lease term plus one five-year renewal term. In November 2005, AVANT amended the MassDevelopment lease to increase the rentable space to approximately 14,300 square feet at the Fall River facility. The landlord is providing a tenant incentive allowance of $49,740 against the cost of alterations and improvements required by AVANT to be made to the expanded space.

RESTRUCTURING On April 16, 2007, AVANT initiated restructuring activities to reduce ongoing operational costs, following an extensive review of its operations and cost structure. The restructuring aimed to increase the focus of AVANT's resources upon key programs and core operational capabilities and to lower the Company's overall cost structure. The Company will concentrate its focus on building an enhanced portfolio of viral and bacterial vaccines for global health and travelers around the Company's core technologies, as well as its unique development and manufacturing capabilities. AVANT will no longer invest in biodefense research and development activities or further invest in clinical trials for its cardiovascular programs. The restructuring resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 30%. AVANT also exited from its St. Louis-based research facility at September 30, 2007 when the lease term expired and has moved all essential research activities to its Needham, MA headquarters. The restructuring charges consisted of severance, payroll tax and extended benefits costs for terminated employees, as well as, salary continuation and retention bonus costs for certain St. Louis employees retained during the transition and closing process for the St. Louis facility. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2007, restructuring charges of $765,204 were recorded, of which $754,877 were recorded as research and development and $10,327 were recorded as general and administrative expense.

Our annual meeting of stockholders is generally held to coincide with one of the Board's regularly scheduled meetings. AVANT does not have a formal policy requiring members of the Board of Directors to attend our annual meetings, although 96 all directors typically attend the annual meeting. Each of the then current directors attended the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders. Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee currently consisting of Larry Ellberger, Chairman, Harry H. Penner, Jr., and Karen Shoos Lipton. During 2007, Peter A. Sears and Francis Cano also were members of the Audit Committee prior to their resignations. The Audit Committee makes recommendations concerning the engagement of independent public accountants, reviews with the independent public accountants the scope and results of the audit engagement, approves professional services provided by the independent public accountants, reviews the independence of the independent public accountants, considers the range of audit and non-audit fees, and reviews the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as that term is defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and auditing matters to serve on the Committee. The Board has designated Larry Ellberger as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The Audit Committee met eight times during 2007. Our Board has adopted an Audit Committee Charter, which is available for viewing at www.avantimmune.com. Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has established a Compensation Committee currently consisting of Karen Shoos Lipton, Chairman, Harry H. Penner, Jr. and Larry Ellberger. During 2007, Peter A. Sears, Alf Lindberg and Francis Cano also were members of the Compensation Committee prior to their resignations. The primary function of the Compensation Committee is to assist the Board in the establishment of compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and, upon her recommendation, to approve the compensation of other officers and senior employees and to approve certain other personnel and employee benefit matters. The Compensation Committee met four times during 2007. Our Board has adopted a Compensation Committee Charter, which is available for viewing at www.avantimmune.com. Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board of Directors has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consisting of Karen Shoos Lipton, Chairman, and Harry H. Penner, Jr. Alf Lindberg, also was a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in 2007 prior to his resignation. The primary function of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to assist the Board in reviewing, investigating and addressing issues regarding Board composition, policy and structure; membership on Board committees; and other matters regarding the governance of AVANT. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once during 2007. Our Board has adopted a Nominating and Corporate Governance Charter, which is available for viewing at www.avantimmune.com. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is "independent" as that term is defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The process followed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to identify and evaluate candidates includes (i) the review of requests from Board members, management, members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, stockholders and other external sources; (ii) meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates to the Board; and (iii) interviews of selected candidates by members of the Committee and the Board. All nominees must have, at a minimum, high personal and professional integrity, exceptional ability and judgment, and be effective in collectively serving the long-term interests of all stockholders. Other qualifications that may be considered by the Committee are described in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Charter. Stockholders may recommend individuals to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting their names and background 97 to the Secretary of AVANT at the address set forth below under "Stockholder Communications." All such recommendations will be forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which will review and consider only such recommendations if appropriate biographical and other information is provided, as described below, on a timely basis. All securityholder recommendations for director candidates must be submitted to AVANT not less than 120 calendar days prior to the date on which AVANT's proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting, and must include the following information: the name and address of record of the securityholder; a representation that the securityholder is a record holder of AVANT's securities, or if the securityholder is not a record holder, evidence of ownership in accordance with Rule 14a-8(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; the name, age, business and residential address, educational background, current principal occupation or employment, and principal occupation or employment for the preceding five (5) full fiscal years of the proposed director candidate; a description of the qualifications and background of the proposed director candidate which addresses the minimum qualifications and other criteria for Board membership approved by the Board from time to time and set forth in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's written charter; A description of any arrangements or understandings between the securityholder and the proposed director candidate; and The consent of the proposed director candidate to be named in the proxy statement relating to AVANT's annual meeting of stockholders and to serve as a director if elected at such annual meeting. Assuming that appropriate information is provided for candidates recommended by stockholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate those candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as for candidates submitted by Board members or other persons, as described above and as set forth in its written charter. Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Overview We believe that the compensation of our executive officers should focus executive behavior on the achievement of near-term corporate targets as well as long-term business objectives and strategies. We place significance on the data reported in the 2006 executive compensation survey of over 400 biotechnology companies independently prepared by Aon-Radford and on pay-for-performance compensation programs, which reward our executives when we achieve certain financial and business goals and create stockholder value. We use a combination of base salary, annual cash incentive compensation programs, a long-term equity incentive compensation program and a broad based benefits program to create a competitive compensation package for our executive management team. We describe below our compensation philosophy, policies and practices with respect to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and our other executive officers, who are collectively referred to as our named executive officers. 98 Administration and Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised of non-employee directors, is responsible for establishing and administering the policies governing the compensation of AVANT's employees, including salary, bonus and stock option grants. The policy of the Compensation Committee is to compensate our employees with competitive salaries based on their level of experience and job performance. All permanent employees, including executive officers, are eligible for annual bonus awards based on achievement of AVANT's strategic corporate goals, and participation in our stock option program. The bonus awards and stock option grants are made in accordance with the AVANT Performance Incentive Plan and 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for the administration of our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, in which employees participate on a voluntary basis. Our compensation committee has designed our overall executive compensation program to achieve the following objectives: attract and retain talented and experienced executives motivate and reward executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success provide a competitive compensation package that aligns the interests of our executive officers and stockholders by including a significant variable component which is weighted heavily towards performance-based rewards, based upon achievement of pre-determined goals ensure fairness among the executive management team by recognizing the contributions each executive makes to our success foster a shared commitment among executives by aligning AVANT's and their individual goals, and compensate our executives to manage our business to meet our near-term and long-term objectives We use a mix of short-term compensation (base salaries and cash incentive bonuses) and long-term compensation (equity incentive compensation) to provide a total compensation structure that is designed to achieve these objectives. We determine the percentage mix of compensation structures that we think is appropriate for each of our executive officers. In general, the Compensation Committee believes that a substantial percentage of the compensation of our executive officers should be performance based. The Compensation Committee uses its judgment and experience and the recommendations of the chief executive officer (except for her own compensation) to determine the appropriate mix of compensation for each individual. In determining whether to adjust the compensation of any one of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, we annually take into account the changes, if any, in the following: market compensation levels the contributions made by each executive officer the performance of each executive officer the increases or decreases in responsibilities and roles of each executive officer the business needs for each executive officer the relevance of each executive officer's experience to other potential employers the readiness of each executive officer to assume a more significant role within the organization 99 In addition, with respect to new executive officers, we take into account their prior base salary and annual cash incentives, their expected contribution and our business needs. We believe that our executive officers should be fairly compensated each year relative to market pay levels within our industry and that there should also be internal equity among our executive officers. Executive Compensation Components In order to both attract and retain experienced and qualified executives to manage AVANT, the Compensation Committee's policy on executive compensation is to (i) pay salaries which are competitive with the salaries of executives in comparable positions in the biotechnology industry, and (ii) allow for additional compensation upon achievement of goals under the Performance Incentive Plan and through the appreciation of stock-based incentive awards. This policy is designed to have a significant portion of each executive's total compensation be tied to AVANT's progress in order to incentivize the executive to fully dedicate himself or herself to achievement of corporate goals, and to align the executive's interest with those of our stockholders through equity incentive compensation. Our executive compensation program is primarily composed of base salary, annual incentive cash compensation payable on an annual basis and equity compensation. In addition, we provide our executives with benefits that are generally available to our salaried employees, including medical, dental, group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage and our 401(k) plan. Within the context of the overall objectives of our compensation programs, we determined the specific amounts of compensation to be paid to each of our executives in 2007 based on a number of factors including: our understanding of the amount of compensation generally paid by similarly situated companies to their executives with similar roles and responsibilities the roles and responsibilities of our executives the individual experience and skills of, and expected contributions from, our executives the amounts of compensation being paid to our other executives our executives' historical compensation at AVANT We discuss each of the primary elements of our executive compensation in detail below. While we have identified particular compensation objectives that each element of executive compensation serves, our compensation programs complement each other and collectively serve all of our executive compensation objectives described above. Accordingly, whether or not specifically mentioned below, we believe that, as a part of our overall executive compensation, each element to a greater or lesser extent serves each of our objectives. Base salary. Each executive officer (except the chief executive officer whose performance is reviewed by the Compensation Committee) has an annual performance review with the chief executive officer who makes recommendations on salary increases, promotions and stock option grants to the Compensation Committee. We have historically established base salaries for each of our executives based on many factors, including average salary increases expected in the biotechnology industry in the Boston, Massachusetts area, competition in the marketplace to hire and retain executives, experiences of our Board members and leadership team with respect to salaries and compensation of executives in similarly situated companies in our industry and other similar industries, as well as additional factors which we believe enables us to hire and retain our leadership team in an extremely competitive environment. Our compensation committee annually reviews salary ranges and individual salaries for our executive officers. The base salaries paid to our named executive officers are set forth below in the summary compensation table. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, the annual base salaries of our 100 president and chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, senior vice president of research and development, vice president of research and vice president, medical and regulatory affairs were $440,000, $285,000, $251,121, $161,046, $201,899 and $254,719, respectively. These salaries represent an average increase of approximately 5.5% over the 2006 fiscal year base salaries of these executive officers, excluding the senior vice president of research and development who resigned from AVANT effective July 31, 2007. The salaries in 2007 were either at or slightly above the fiftieth percentile of the salaries paid to persons in comparable positions using an independently prepared 2006 employee compensation survey of over 400 biotechnology companies. We believe that the base salaries paid to our executive officers during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 achieve our executive compensation objectives and are comparable to similarly situated companies. Performance Incentive Plan. We have designed our performance plan program to reward our executive officers upon the achievement of certain annual revenue, cash flow, research, clinical development, regulatory and business development goals, as approved in advance by our compensation committee and the board of directors. The bonus award is based on achievement of AVANT's corporate goals which are set at the beginning of each fiscal year and measured against performance at the end of the year by AVANT in accordance with the Performance Incentive Plan. For 2007, the corporate goals were applicable to all employees, including the executive officers and included (i) overall strategic goals and (ii) goals applicable to our therapeutic programs. The corporate goals were allocated between specific product and financial performance targets. Our performance plan emphasizes pay-for-performance and is intended to closely align executive compensation with achievement of certain operating results and an increase in stockholder value. The compensation committee and the board of directors communicate the bonus criteria to all employees, including the named executive officers, at the beginning of the fiscal year. The performance goals and bonus criteria established by the compensation committee under the Performance Incentive Plan are designed to require significant effort and operational success on the part of our executives and AVANT for achievement. We measure such bonus criteria against actual operating results on an annual basis. Equity Compensation. We also use stock options and equity-based incentive programs to attract, retain, motivate and reward our executive officers. Through our equity-based grants, we seek to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders, reward and motivate both near-term and long-term executive performance and provide an incentive for retention. Our decisions regarding the amount and type of equity incentive compensation and relative weighting of these awards among total executive compensation have been based on our understanding of market practices of similarly situated companies and our negotiations with our executives in connection with their initial employment or promotion. Our recent practice has been to grant equity-based awards to our executive officers, if any at all, on an annual basis. All such grants are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee at a regularly scheduled meeting during the year. The date of grant and the fair market value of the award are based upon the date of the Compensation Committee meeting approving such grant. When granting stock options, the Compensation Committee considers a number of factors in determining the amount of equity incentive awards, if any, to grant to our executives, including: the existing levels of stock ownership among the executive officers relative to each other and to our employees as a whole previous grants of stock options to such executive officers vesting schedules of previously granted options the performance of the executives and their contributions to our overall performance 101 an outside survey of stock option grants and restricted common stock awards in the biotechnology industry an internally prepared survey of similarly situated biotechnology companies' proxy statements personal knowledge of the Compensation Committee members regarding executive stock options and restricted common stock awards at comparable companies the impact of stock option awards on our results of operations and the amount and percentage of our total equity on a diluted basis held by our executives Equity compensation awards to our named executive officers primarily consists of stock option awards. Stock option awards provide our executive officers with the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price typically for a period of up to ten years, subject to continued employment with AVANT. Stock options are earned on the basis of continued service to us and generally vest over four years, beginning with 25% vesting one year after the date of grant, then pro-rata vesting annually thereafter. All historical option grants were made at what our Compensation Committee and board of directors determined to be the fair market value of our shares of our common stock on the respective grant dates. In January 2007, we granted to our president and chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, senior vice president of research and development, vice president of research and vice president, medical and regulatory affairs options to purchase 50,000, 40,000, 25,000, 25,000, 12,000 and 15,000 shares, respectively. In September 2005, November 2004 and September 2003, AVANT also awarded Restricted Stock Units to Dr. Ryan and recorded non-cash deferred compensation amounting to $270,000, $832,000 and $1,104,000, respectively. On September 21, 2006, AVANT's Board of Directors modified these Restricted Stock Units to provide that they vest in their entirety upon the earlier of the sale of AVANT or Dr. Ryan's retirement at or after age 65. We recognize stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R using the fair-value based method for all awards granted on or after the date of our adoption and these values have since been reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the extent and value of our stock-based awards to our executive officers and other employees and directors have a direct effect on the calculation of our operating profit margin, a principal component of variable compensation under our performance plan. In April 2007, we adopted an equity grant policy for 2007 that formalizes how we grant equity awards by setting a regular schedule for grants, outlining grant approval requirements and specifying how awards are priced. We believe that this policy will enable us to avoid any option backdating issues or concerns that our awards were timed to precede or follow our release or withholding of material non-public information. Other Benefits We believe that establishing competitive benefit packages for our employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Executive officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage and our 401(k) plan, in each case on the same basis as other employees. We provide a matching contribution under our 401(k) plan. 102 Summary Compensation Table Name and Principal Position Years Salary ($) Bonus ($)(1) Stock Awards ($)(2) Option Awards ($)(3) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation ($) Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings ($) All Other Compensation ($)(4) Total ($) Una S.

(2)This amount relates to the modification during 2006 of prior awards. No new awards were made to Dr. Ryan in 2006. See "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisExecutive Compensation ComponentsEquity Compensation." The amount represents non-cash deferred compensation recognized under SFAS 123R as a result of the modification in September 2006 of Restricted Stock Unit awards made to Dr. Ryan in September 2003, November 2004 and September 2005 to provide that they vest in their entirety upon the earlier of the sale of AVANT or Dr. Ryan's retirement at or after age 65. Insofar as Dr. Ryan reached age 65 in 2006, under SFAS 123R the entire unamortized fair value of the modified awards ($1,225,000) had to be recognized in 2006 even though Dr. Ryan continues to be an executive officer of AVANT. The Restricted Stock Unit awards made to Dr. Ryan were settled for stock on a one-for-one basis upon the consummation of the Merger on March 7, 2008. (3)The amounts in the Option Awards column reflect the dollar amounts recognized for financial statement purposes for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, in accordance with FAS 123(R), (excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions), for awards pursuant the AVANT 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, and thus may include amounts attributable to awards granted during and before 2007 and 2006. Assumptions made in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 5. These numbers do not reflect the 1-for-12 reverse stock split effected on March 7, 2008.

Employment Agreements Dr. Ryan entered into an employment agreement with AVANT (the "agreement"), which was amended and restated as of August 20, 1998, amended as of December 23, 2002, September 18, 2003 and again as of October 19, 2007. The term of the agreement is for 13 months from the effective date of the merger, with rolling automatic one-year extensions. If prior to a change in control (as defined in the AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan), Dr. Ryan's employment is terminated by AVANT without cause (as defined in the agreement), Dr. Ryan will be eligible to receive a lump sum amount equal to one year's salary, at the rate then in effect, and continuation of group health plan benefits for a period of up to twelve (12) months. If within a year after a change in control, Dr. Ryan's employment is terminated by AVANT without cause or by Dr. Ryan for good reason (as defined in the agreement), or if a change in control occurs within one (1) year after Dr. Ryan is terminated without cause by AVANT, Dr. Ryan is entitled to receive a lump sum amount equal to three (3) times the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) applicable to Dr. Ryan, less one dollar ($1.00). Such severance may be further reduced to the extent necessary to preserve AVANT's tax deduction. Further, if Dr. Ryan's employment is terminated by AVANT without cause or by Dr. Ryan for good reason at any time after the merger, or Dr. Ryan resigns or is terminated by AVANT or after the first anniversary of the merger for any reason, AVANT will pay Dr. Ryan a special retirement payment of $1,323,203. In September 2005, November 2004 and September 2003, AVANT also awarded Restricted Stock Units to Dr. Ryan and recorded non-cash deferred compensation amounting to $270,000, $832,000 and $1,104,000, respectively. On September 21, 2006, AVANT's Board of Directors modified these Restricted Stock Units to provide that they vest in their entirety upon the earlier of the sale of AVANT or Dr. Ryan's 106 retirement at or after age 65. Dr. Ryan reached age 65 in December 2006. These units will be settled in shares of common stock of AVANT upon a change in control of AVANT. Dr. Cooke entered into a letter agreement with AVANT on June 10, 2004 (the "Letter Agreement"), which provides for AVANT's employment of Dr. Cooke, as a Senior Vice President of Commercial Development, beginning on June 21, 2004. Under the terms of the Letter Agreement, if (1) there has been a Change of Control of AVANT (as defined in the Letter Agreement) and Dr. Cooke's employment is thereafter terminated by Dr. Cooke for other than Good Reason (as defined in the Letter Agreement), or (2) there has been a Change of Control of AVANT and Dr. Cooke's employment is thereafter terminated for Cause (as defined in the Letter Agreement) by AVANT, death, Disability or Retirement (each as defined in the Letter Agreement), then no benefits shall be payable to Dr. Cooke. If Dr. Cooke's employment is terminated within one (1) year following a Change in Control of AVANT by Dr. Cooke for Good Reason or by AVANT other than for Cause, death, Disability or Retirement, then Dr. Cooke's benefits shall be those described in the Letter Agreement, including the continuance of Dr. Cooke's base salary for 12 months and a 100% vesting of all unvested options. On June 14, 2004, Dr. Cooke's employment terms were amended (the "Amended Letter Agreement") such that AVANT agreed to pay Dr. Cooke six months of severance (at the rate of his final base pay) if Dr. Cooke's employment is terminated by AVANT without cause. This Amended Letter Agreement provides that Dr. Cooke is employed on an at-will basis and also allows for Dr. Cooke to receive health and dental benefits during this severance period. Dr. Cooke was promoted to chief operating officer March 21, 2005 however, his employment terms pursuant to this Letter Agreement remained the same. Dr. Cooke resigned from AVANT on February 11, 2008. Mr. Catlin and Dr. Marsh have agreements with AVANT under which each is eligible for a severance payment of twelve months' base salary, continuation of health insurance benefits for twelve months and 100% vesting of all stock option grants in the event of his termination following a change-of-control, as defined in the AVANT Immunotherapeutics, Inc. 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. Pension Benefits None of our named executive officers participate in qualified or nonqualified defined benefit plans sponsored by AVANT. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation None of our named executive officers are covered by a defined contribution or other plan that provides for the deferral of compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified. Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control Certain of our named executive officers have provisions in their employment agreements regarding severance upon certain termination events or acceleration of stock options in the event of a change of control of AVANT or termination following a change of control. These severance and acceleration provisions are described in "Employment Agreements," and certain estimates of these change of control benefits are provided in the table below. 107 Una S.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE It is our policy that all employees and directors, as well as their family members, must avoid any activity that is or has the appearance of conflicting with AVANT's business interest. This policy is included in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. All directors and officers of AVANT complete a directors and officers questionnaire at the beginning of each year, in which they are asked to disclose family relationships and other related party transactions. Our Audit Committee must review and approve all related party transactions, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Our Audit Committee's procedures for reviewing related party transactions are not in writing. In fiscal 2007, there were no related party transactions. Director Independence For information on director independence, please see Item 10 above under the caption "The Board of Directors and Its Committees." Item 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES The Audit Committee approved the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as AVANT's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2007. Audit Fees Represents fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of AVANT's annual audited financial statements and reviews of AVANT's quarterly financial statements, advice on accounting matters directly related to the audit and audit services provided in connection with other statutory or regulatory filings. Fees, including out of pocket expenses, for the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 audit, including assurance services provided in connection with the assessment and testing of internal controls pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, quarterly reviews of Forms 10-Q during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and in connection with the Celldex Merger entered into in 2007 were $443,400 and $374,550, respectively. Audit-Related Fees Audit-related fees are for assurance and other activities not explicitly related to the audit of AVANT's financial statements, and consisted principally of fees for consultations concerning financial 114 accounting and reporting standards. There were no audit-related fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for fiscal 2007 and 2006. Tax Fees Tax fees are associated with tax compliance, tax advice, tax planning and tax preparation services. In 2007 and 2006, we engaged another public accounting firm to perform these services. All Other Fees Other fees of $1,500 were billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all auditing services and the terms thereof and non-audit services (other than non-audit services prohibited under Section 10A(g) of the Exchange Act or the applicable rules of the SEC or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) to be provided to AVANT by the independent auditor. However, the pre-approval requirement may be waived with respect to the provision of non-audit services for AVANT if the "de minimus" provisions of Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act are satisfied. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees, and all other fees as described above is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP's independence and has determined that such services for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 were compatible. All such services were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act to the extent that rule was applicable. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing the audit financial statements with management, discussing with the independent auditors the matters required in Auditing Standards No. 61, receiving written disclosures from the independent auditors required by ISB No.1 and discussing with the independent auditors their independence, and recommending to the board of directors that the audit financial statements be included in the company's annual report of Form 10-K. 115 PART IV Item 15.
