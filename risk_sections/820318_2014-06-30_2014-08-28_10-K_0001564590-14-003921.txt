Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The Company cautions investors that its performance and, therefore, any forward-looking statement, is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause the Company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. We May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses, Which May Adversely Affect our Results and Affect the Value of our Stock Following Such Acquisitions Our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. We have completed various acquisitions that we believe will be beneficial to the Company and our shareholders. The success of these acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating and successfully running the businesses acquired. The strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business involves numerous potential risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired business and products, uncertainties associated with operating in new markets, working with new customers and the potential loss of the acquired company’s key personnel. In addition, acquired businesses may experience operating losses as of, and subsequent to, the acquisition date. Further, we recently significantly increased our long-term debt to finance these acquisitions, the costs of which (in terms of interest expense and similar debt service costs), must be weighed against the potential benefits of such acquisitions. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and as a result our results of operations, financial position, and cash flow may be adversely affected. Further, any future business acquisitions completed by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The following information relates to acquisitions made during the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2012 Near-Infrared Optics 100 % Declines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segment’s Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As of June 30, 2014, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $196.1 million and $16.4 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 16 Continued U.S. Budget Deficits Could Result in Significant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs, which Could Adversely Impact the Company Specific to the military business within our Infrared Optics, Military & Materials and Advanced Products Group segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled between 15% and 20% of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. These customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment, such as the recent sequestration of the defense budget, which could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. General Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical markets in which we participate. Because all components of our forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. In addition, changes in general economic conditions may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products due to economic downturn, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere; adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy; contractions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit; and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products, increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, increase the cost and availability of financing and increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately 65%, 56% and 58% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, we manufacture products in China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Australia and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and Malaysia, and maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore and Italy. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, the global economic uncertainties, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business in the local currency could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition by rendering us less price-competitive than foreign manufacturers. Keeping Pace with Key Industry Developments is Essential We are engaged in industries that will be affected by future developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if we do not gain market acceptance for the same. 17 Our Continued Success Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes In order to meet our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop, manufacture and market new products, develop new processes and improve existing processes. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. Our success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing and product performance in the field. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply We utilize high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. ZnSe is available from only one significant outside source whose quantities and quality of ZnSe may be limited. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe would have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Therefore, an inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and utilize other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (YLF), Calcium Fluoride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon Carbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. New Regulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact Our Business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite, including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten, known as “conflict minerals,” originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (together known as the "covered countries"). Pursuant to these rules, the SEC recently has adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such minerals were 18 mined from the covered countries, beginning in 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, particularly if it turns out that there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals that are not from recycled or scrap sources, can be traced to a country of origin other than the covered countries, or can be traced to a source within the covered countries that definitely does not finance or benefit armed groups in those countries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals originating from the covered countries and we cannot definitively determine whether the conflict minerals financed or otherwise benefited armed groups, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement. Some Systems That Utilize our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues Some systems that utilize our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers’ manufacturing processes or the use of defective or contaminated materials could adversely impact our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve acceptable yields or product reliability, our business, results of operation, financial condition or customer relationships could be materially adversely affected. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to fix defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; damage to our brand reputation; failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; diversion of development and engineering resources; or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Encounter Substantial Competition We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The Market Price of Our Common Stock and the Stock Market in General Can Be Highly Volatile Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things: general economic and market conditions; actual or anticipated variations in operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations; conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our Common Stock. Many of these factors are beyond our control. These factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. Because We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will Benefit From an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, as we currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business . As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which a shareholder originally purchased its shares. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or 19 attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. As a result, the negative impact from changes in commodity prices, such as the recent decline in global selenium prices may not be recovered through our product sales, and as such could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. In the event that the global index price of selenium experiences a further decline from its current level, the Company would be required to record an additional write-down of its selenium inventory in future periods. Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover or make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: a requirement that shareholder nominated board nominees be nominated in advance of a meeting to elect such directors and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock. We Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation We use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment resulting from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. 20 Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation We are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. entities, including, but not limited to, the following: · We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory. · Exported technology necessary to develop and manufacture certain of the Company’s products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions, and the Company may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In many cases, exports of technology necessary to develop and manufacture the Company’s products are subject to U.S. export control laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the U.S. · Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. 21 We May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulation In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting or contemplating enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory or voluntary, and have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold. Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Results Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Data Hacking Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property [both proprietary and of our customers], as well as proprietary business information. We have in place a number of controls, processes and practices designed to protect against intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our networks, systems and information or disruption of our operations due to a hacking or cyber-incident. Despite such efforts, we could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of the information we are trying to protect. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced a material impact, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. 22 Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The update's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and prohibits early adoption. The update allows for the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective approach of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the available transition methods and the potential impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued an ASU that changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. Under the new guidance, a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued an ASU that changes how certain unrecognized tax benefits are to be presented on the consolidated balance sheet. This ASU clarified existing guidance to require that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion thereof be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when an NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. In such a case, the unrecognized tax benefit would be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability. This update is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued an ASU related to a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon de-recognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The update clarifies the applicable guidance under current U.S. GAAP for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment upon a reporting entity’s de-recognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity or part or all of its investment in a foreign entity. The update requires a reporting entity, which either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity, to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income. This update is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued an ASU related to disclosure requirements of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The adoption of the guidance requires the Company to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, the Company is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. This update was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 23
