Item 1A. Risk FactorsOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The most significant of these risks include those described below; however, there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC.Disruptions in the worldwide economy and the financial markets may adversely impact our business and results of operations.Adverse and uncertain economic and market conditions, particularly in the locations in which we operate, may impact customer and consumer demand for our products and our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Consumers may also reduce the number of organic and natural products that they purchase where there are conventional alternatives, given that organic and natural products generally have higher retail prices than do their conventional counterparts. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products, which generally have lower retail prices than do their branded counterparts. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers, our ability to attract new customers, the financial condition of our customers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price.Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on any of these factors and, therefore, could adversely impact our sales and profitability.Our markets are highly competitive.We operate in highly competitive geographic and product markets. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, where competition is based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, product innovation and promotional activity, availability and taste among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Some of our markets are dominated by multinational corporations with greater resources and more substantial operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete for sales to distributors or retailers that purchase from larger competitors that have greater financial, managerial, sales and technical resources. Conventional food companies, including but not limited to Campbell Soup Company, The WhiteWave Foods Company, Mondelez International, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Groupe Danone, The J.M. Smucker Company, Kellogg Company, Kraft Foods Inc., Nestle S.A., PepsiCo, Inc. and Unilever, PLC, and conventional personal care products companies, including but not limited to The Proctor and Gamble Company, Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive, may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. We also compete with other organic and natural packaged food brands and companies, including Annie’s, Inc., Nature’s Path Foods, Inc. and Amy’s Kitchen, and with smaller companies, which may be more innovative, able to bring new products to market faster and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. As a result of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. As a result, we may need to increase our marketing, advertising and promotional spending to protect our existing market share, which may result in an adverse impact on our profitability.Consumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change.Our business is primarily focused on sales of organic and natural products which, if consumer demand for such categories were to decrease, could harm our business. In addition, we have other product categories which are subject to evolving consumer preferences.11Table of ContentsConsumer trends could change based on a number of possible factors, including:•dietary habits and nutritional values, such as fat content or sodium levels;•concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients, such as sugar or processed wheat;•a shift in preference from organic to non-organic and from natural products to non-natural products;•the availability of competing private label products offered by retailers; and•economic factors and social trends.A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or our failure to maintain our current market position could reduce our sales or the prestige of our brands in our markets, which could harm our business. While we continue to diversify our product offerings, developing new products entails risks and we cannot be certain that demand for our products will continue at current levels or increase in the future.Our growth is dependent on our ability to introduce new products and improve existing products.Our growth depends in part on our ability to generate and implement improvements to our existing products and to introduce new products to consumers. The success of our innovation and product improvement effort is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumers preferences, the level of funding that can be made available, the technical capability of our research and development staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with governmental regulations, and the success of our management in introducing the resulting improvements in a timely manner. If we are unsuccessful in implementing product improvements or introducing new products that satisfy the demands of consumers, our business could be harmed.Our acquisition strategy exposes us to risk, including our ability to integrate the brands that we acquire.We intend to continue to grow our business in part through the acquisition of new brands, both in the United States and internationally. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing product mix and identifying and acquiring brands in new categories and in new geographies for purposes of expanding our business internationally. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully:•identify suitable acquisition candidates;•negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on terms acceptable to us; or•integrate acquisitions that we complete.We may encounter increased competition for acquisitions in the future, which could result in acquisition prices we do not consider acceptable. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed. Furthermore, acquisition-related costs are required to be expensed as incurred even though the acquisition may not be completed.The success of acquisitions we make will be dependent upon our ability to effectively integrate those brands, including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings, some of which may involve operational changes. Despite our due diligence investigation of each business that we acquire, there may be liabilities of the acquired companies that we fail to or are unable to discover during the due diligence investigation and for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. We cannot be certain: •as to the timing or number of marketing opportunities or amount of cost savings that may be realized as the result of our integration of an acquired brand;•that a business combination will enhance our competitive position and business prospects;•that we will be successful if we enter categories or markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•that we will be able to coordinate a greater number of diverse businesses and business located in a greater number of geographic locations;•that we will not experience difficulties with customers, personnel or other parties as a result of a business combination•that we will not enter into disputes with sellers; or•that, with respect to our acquisitions outside the United States, we will not be affected by, among other things, exchange rate risk and risks associated with local regulatory regimes.Companies or brands acquired may not achieve the level of sales or profitability that justify the investment made. We may determine to discontinue products if they do not meet, among other reasons, our standards for quality or profitability or both, which may have a material adverse effect on sales relating to such acquisition.12Table of ContentsWe cannot be certain that we will be successful in:•integrating an acquired brand’s distribution channels with our own;•coordinating sales force activities of an acquired brand or in selling the products of an acquired brand to our customer base; or•integrating an acquired brand into our management information systems or integrating an acquired brand’s products into our product mix.Additionally, integrating an acquired brand into our existing operations will require management resources and may divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in integrating the operations of acquired brands, our business could be harmed.We may not be able to successfully consummate proposed divestitures.We may, from time to time, divest businesses that become less of a strategic fit within our portfolio or no longer meet our growth or profitability targets. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sales of such businesses, or lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to divested businesses, or indemnify buyers for liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. We may also not be able to negotiate such divestitures on terms acceptable to us. Such potential divestitures will require management resources and may divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in divesting such businesses, our business could be harmed.We may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience.We intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to enter into new markets. This may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries. This may have a material adverse effect on our business.We are dependent upon the services of our Chief Executive Officer and senior management team.We are highly dependent upon the services of Irwin D. Simon, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe Mr. Simon’s reputation as our founder and his expertise and knowledge in the organic and natural products industry are critical factors in our continuing growth. His relationships with customers and suppliers are not easily found elsewhere in the organic and natural products industry. The loss of the services of Mr. Simon could harm our business.Additionally, if we lose one or more members of our senior management team, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed.We rely on independent distributors for a substantial portion of our sales.We rely upon sales made by or through non-affiliated distributors to customers. Distributors purchase directly for their own account for resale. One distributor, United Natural Foods, Inc., which redistributes products to natural foods supermarkets, independent natural retailers and other retailers, accounted for approximately 13%, 15% and 18% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The loss of, or business disruption at, one or more of these distributors may harm our business. If we are required to obtain additional or alternative distribution agreements or arrangements in the future, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory distribution agreements may inhibit our ability to implement our business plan or to establish markets necessary to expand the distribution of our products successfully. 13Table of ContentsConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability.Customers, such as supermarkets and food distributors in North America and the European Union continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases or demand increased promotional programs, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business.Our largest customer, United Natural Foods, Inc., a distributor, accounted for approximately 13%, 15% and 18% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which were primarily related to the United States segment. A second customer, Walmart and its affiliates Sam’s Club and ASDA, together accounted for approximately 11% and 10% of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, which were primarily related to the United States and United Kingdom segments. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the past three fiscal years. The loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. Loss of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or independent co-packers or distribution centers could harm our business.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 57%, 55% and 48%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at our own manufacturing facilities. An interruption in or the loss of operations at one or more of these facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, governmental actions, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay or postpone production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as the interruption of operations is resolved or an alternate source of production could be secured. In addition, if one or more of our manufacturing facilities are running at full capacity and we are unable to keep up with customer demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders on time or at all which could adversely impact our business.During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 43%, 45% and 52%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at independent co-packers. In some cases an individual co-packer may produce all of our requirements for a particular brand. The success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform. We believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-packers in the industry, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative co-packing agreements or arrangements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms in a timely manner. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-packers, disruptions or delays at a co-packer, or our failure to retain co-packers for newly acquired products or brands, could delay or postpone production of our products or reduce or eliminate the availability of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the success of our business depends, in large part, upon dependable transportation systems and a strong distribution network. A disruption in transportation services could result in an inability to supply materials to our or our co-packers’ facilities. We utilize distribution centers which are managed by third parties. Activity at these distribution centers could be disrupted by a number of factors, including labor issues, failure to meet customer standards, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters or bankruptcy or other financial issues affecting the third party providers. Any extended disruption in the distribution of our products or an increase in the cost of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business.14Table of ContentsIf we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected.The inability of any supplier of raw materials, independent co-packer or third party distributor to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to increase and our profit margins to decrease, especially as it relates to our products that have a short shelf life. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory on hand that may reach its expiration date and become unsaleable. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease.Our future results of operations may be adversely affected by the availability of organic ingredients.Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of organic ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow organic crops, climate conditions, changes in national and world economic conditions, currency fluctuations and forecasting adequate need of seasonal ingredients.The organic ingredients that we use in the production of our products (including, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains) are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and pestilences. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of organic ingredients or increase the prices of organic ingredients. If our supplies of organic ingredients are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms, if at all, which could impact our ability to supply product to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also compete with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic product ingredients, which may be less plentiful in the open market than conventional product ingredients. This competition may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic products increases. This could cause our expenses to increase or could limit the amount of product that we can manufacture and sell.Our future results of operations may be adversely affected by increased fuel, raw materials and commodity costs.Many aspects of our business have been, and may continue to be, directly affected by the rising cost of fuel and commodities. Increased fuel costs translate into increased costs for the products and services we receive from our third party providers including, but not limited to, increased distribution costs for our products and increased packaging costs. Agricultural commodities and ingredients, including wheat, rice, corn, soybeans, almonds, oils and dairy are the principal inputs used in our products. These items are subject to price volatility which can be caused by commodity market fluctuations, crop yields, seasonal cycles, weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and hurricanes), pest and disease problems, changes in currency exchange rates, imbalances between supply and demand, natural disasters and government programs and policies among other factors. We seek to offset the impact of these cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives, operating efficiencies and price increases to our customers. However, if we are unable to fully offset such cost increases our financial results could be adversely affected.Our ability to offset the impact of cost input inflation on our operations is partially dependent on our ability to implement and achieve targeted savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.We continuously seek to put in place initiatives which are designed to control or reduce costs or that increase operating efficiencies in order to improve our profitability and offset many of the input cost increases which are outside of our control. Our success depends on our ability to execute and realize cost savings and efficiencies from our operations. If we are unable to identify and fully implement our productivity plans and achieve our anticipated efficiencies our profitability may be adversely impacted.Our profit margins also depend on our ability to manage our inventory efficiently. As part of our effort to manage our inventory more efficiently, we carry out stock-keeping unit (“SKU”) rationalization programs from time to time, which may result in the discontinuation of numerous lower-margin or low-turnover SKUs. However, a number of factors, such as changes in customers’ inventory levels, access to shelf space and changes in consumer preferences, may lengthen the number of days we carry certain inventories, hence impeding our effort to manage our inventory efficiently and thereby increasing our costs.15Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations, including foreign currency risks.Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which are volatile at times. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. Consequently, isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors. These changes, if material, could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies.We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the United States dollar, primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar and the Euro. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses into United States dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar during a period may unpredictably and adversely impact our consolidated operating results, our asset and liability balances and our cash flows in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.During fiscal 2014, approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside the United States, while such sales outside the United States were 37% of net sales in 2013 and 28% in 2012. Sales from outside our United States markets may continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales in the future. Our non-U.S. sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, many of which are outside our control, including: •periodic economic downturns and the instability of governments, including the threat of war, terrorist attacks, epidemic or civil unrest;•price and foreign currency exchange controls;•fluctuations in the relative values of currencies;•unexpected changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers;•compliance with applicable foreign laws;•the imposition of tariffs or quotas;•changes in tax laws; and•difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors.Our inability to use our trademarks could have a material adverse effect on our business.We believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer’s decision to purchase one product over another in the highly competitive food, beverage and personal care industries. Although we endeavor to protect our trademarks and trade names, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, or that third parties will not challenge our right to use one or more of our trademarks or trade names. We believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant to the marketing and sale of our products and that the inability to utilize certain of these names could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, we market products under brands licensed under trademark license agreements, including Linda McCartney®, the Sesame Street name and logo and other Sesame Workshop intellectual property on certain of our Earth’s Best® products, Cadbury®, Rose’s® and Candle Cafe™ brand. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are instrumental in our ability to create and sustain demand for and to market those products offerings. We cannot assure you that these trademark license agreements will remain in effect and enforceable or that any license agreements, upon expiration, can be renewed on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any future disputes concerning these trademark license agreements may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the disputed trademarks and suspend sales of products using such trademarks.We are subject to U.S and international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to extensive regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe and any other countries where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the sourcing, manufacturing, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising, and distributing of these products. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.16Table of ContentsAs a publicly traded company, we are further subject to federal rules and regulations as well as the rules of the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the NASDAQ® Global Select Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws recently enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities.With our expanding international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials, substances and waste used in or resulting from our operations. Liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters could have a significant negative impact on our business.As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, the nature of our operations expose us to the risk of liabilities and claims with respect to environmental matters, including those relating to the disposal and release of hazardous substances. Furthermore, our operations are governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health which, among other things, regulate employee exposure to hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Any material costs incurred in connection with such liabilities or claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Any environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations enacted in the future, or any changes in how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted may lead to an increase in compliance costs or expose us to additional risk of liabilities and claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.Our financial success is directly dependent on the consumer perception of our brands. The success of our brands may suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, our results could be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issues or the Company is perceived to act in an irresponsible manner. In addition, it is possible for such information, misperceptions, and opinions to be shared quickly and disseminated widely due to the continued growing use of social and digital media.We may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause illness or physical harm.The sale of products for human use and consumption involves the risk of injury or illness to consumers. Such injuries may result from inadvertent mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination or spoilage. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall or withdraw products, suspend production of our products or cease operations, which may lead to a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, customers may cancel orders for such products as a result of such events. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal, product liability claims might be asserted against us. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities and those of our co-packers and suppliers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm, including the risk of reputational harm being magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the Internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms and social media sites, could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this type might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount that we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.17Table of ContentsWe may be subject to significant liability that is not covered by insurance.We believe that the extent of our insurance coverage is consistent with industry practice. However, any claim under our insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions, may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not have purchased sufficient insurance to cover all losses incurred. If we were to incur substantial liabilities or if our business operations were interrupted for a substantial period of time, we could incur costs and suffer losses. Such inventory and business interruption losses may not be covered by our insurance policies. Additionally, in the future, insurance coverage may not be available to us at commercially acceptable premiums, or at all.We rely on independent certification for a number of our products.We rely on independent certification, such as certifications of our products as “organic”, “Non-GMO”, or “kosher,” to differentiate our products from others. The loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our market position as an organic and natural products company, which could harm our business.We must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified. For example, we can lose our “organic” certification if a manufacturing plant becomes contaminated with non-organic materials, or if it is not properly cleaned after a production run. In addition, all raw materials must be certified organic. Similarly, we can lose our “kosher” certification if a manufacturing plant and raw materials do not meet the requirements of the appropriate kosher supervision organization.Due to the seasonality of many of our products and other factors, our results of operations are subject to quarterly fluctuations. We manufacture and market hot tea products and soups, and as a result, our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for our hot tea products and soups in the cooler months of the year. In addition, some of our other products also show stronger sales in the cooler months while our snack food product lines and certain of our prepared food products are stronger in the warmer months.Quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and results of operations are due to a number of factors relating to our business, including the timing of trade promotions, advertising, consumer promotions and other factors, such as seasonality, inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor, commodity, energy or other operating costs. The impact on sales volume and results of operations due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business. For these reasons, you should not rely on our sales, operating results or cash flows in any quarter in a fiscal year as indicators for other quarters in that fiscal year.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately $1.79 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets (primarily indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with our brands) on our balance sheet as a result of the acquisitions we have made since our inception. The value of these intangible assets depends on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, market conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to these intangibles may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in market interest rates or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires considerable judgment. We determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. Significant and unanticipated changes in the value of our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could require a charge for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our consolidated earnings in the period of such charge. In addition, such charges would reduce our consolidated net worth. Our reviews in fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 did not indicate an impairment related to our continuing operations; however, if our common stock price trades below book value per share for a sustained period, if there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or if future interim or annual impairment tests indicate an impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may have to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges which may materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. For further details, see Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. 18Table of ContentsJoint ventures that we enter into present a number of risks and challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.As part of our business strategy, we have made minority interest investments and established joint ventures. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial and other challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies and changes in the industry, location or political environment in which these investments are located, that may arise after entering into such arrangements. We could experience financial or other setbacks if these transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution by the management of the companies underlying these investments. Any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations.Additionally, we do not have operating control of our joint venture. Because we do not own a majority or maintain voting control of our joint venture, we do not have the ability to control its policies, management or affairs. The management team of the joint venture could make business decisions without our consent that could impair the economic value of our investments. Any such diminution in the value of our investments could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, system failures, security breaches, and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.Pending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs. We are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, the marketing and labeling of products, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Even when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets and revolving credit agreement will permit us to meeting our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets and the state of the economy, including the food and beverage industry, will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Such disruptions could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.Failure to meet expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the price and volatility of our stock.Failure to meet expectations, particularly with respect to net sales, earnings per share and operating cash flows may result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the price of our stock. In addition, volatility in the stock market as a whole may affect the price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.19Table of ContentsOur Officers and Directors may be able to control our actions.Our officers and directors beneficially owned (assuming the exercise of all stock options held by our officers and directors) approximately 4.8% of our common stock as of June 30, 2014. Accordingly, our officers and directors may be in a position to influence the election of our directors and otherwise influence stockholder action. Our ability to issue preferred stock may deter takeover attempts.Our board of directors is empowered to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights which could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our common stock and adversely affect the relative voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock, we may do so in the future under appropriate circumstances. Item 1B.
