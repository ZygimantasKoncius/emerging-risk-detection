Item 1A. Risk Factors The following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business. They are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Risks Particular To Purple Communications We are integrating five businesses that previously operated independently as GoAmerica Communications, Verizons TRS division, HOVRS, SLA and VLI. We cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate and manage these businesses effectively. Although the businesses of these five companies are complementary, the integration of the departments, systems business units, operating procedures and information technologies of the five businesses present a significant challenge. Although we have made significant progress in its integration efforts we cannot assure you that there will not be issues and inefficiencies arising to the business from the integration and management of these operations nor can we assure you that we will improve the historical financial performances of Purple Communications, Verizons TRS division, Hands On, SLA and VLI. The failure to successfully integrate these systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. In addition, the continuing process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined companys businesses. The diversion of managements attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As described under Item 1. Business of the Company, NECA could decrease its reimbursement rates in the future, which could materially adversely affect the Company. As a provider of relay services, the Company is reimbursed monthly from the federal TRS fund for each IP relay and VRS conversation minute. The current IP relay rate is currently $1.287 per minute, and although the IP relay rate has been established for three yearsthrough the 2009-2010 reimbursement yearit is subject to an annual 0.5% reduction (among other fluctuating adjustments that may or may not raise the rates). The reimbursement rate for VRS, which currently is $6.74 per minute for the first 50,000 monthly minutes, $6.47 per minute for monthly minutes between 50,001 and 500,000, and $6.27 per minute for monthly minutes above 500,000, has also been established (subject to an annual 0.5% reduction) for a three-year period ending in the 2009-2010 reimbursement year. Although these three-year reimbursement rate plans provide increased rate stability from year to year, unanticipated changes to these rates by the FCC or decreases in future three-year reimbursement rates could materially adversely affect our revenues, and we cannot assure you that the FCC, under a new administration, will not introduce a change or decrease to the reimbursement rates prior to contemplated end of the current rate plan ending 2010. We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations. We had approximately $70 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2008. We have a term loan from Churchill Financial LLC as administrative agent and Cerebus/Ableco, as collateral agent, for $40 million and a revolving line of credit with Churchill for up to $13 million, of which there was $13 million in availability as of 13 Table of Contents December 31, 2008. The maturity date of the term loan is January 10, 2014, and the maturity date for revolving loans made from time to time is January 10, 2013. We also have a subordinated (or second lien) loan from Clearlake, as administrative agent, and Reservoir Capital as collateral agent, for $30 million, with a maturity date of January 10, 2015. Our indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations at maturity, extend the maturity dates of our credit agreements or refinance our indebtedness at maturity, we may be required to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or sell some of our assets. We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due or raise equity capital on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we have to sell some of our assets to satisfy indebtedness, the timing of such sales may not enable us to maximize the value of such assets. The failure to refinance, raise capital or sell assets, if required, sufficient to meet our debt obligations as they become due would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Failure to satisfy covenants under our credit agreements could accelerate our obligations under such credit agreements, which would result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our credit agreements with first and second lien lenders contain financial and other covenants that we must satisfy. Our ability to continue to borrow under our revolving line of credit depends upon our ability to comply with those covenants. Financial covenants in the credit agreements include, among others, limits on maximum consolidated leverage, maximum amounts of capital expenditures, minimum amount of net revenue, and having minimum reserves on our books. If we fail to satisfy any of our covenants, the lender may elect to accelerate our payment obligations under the credit agreement. In addition, failure to satisfy any of the covenants or to otherwise default under either of the credit agreements would also cause a default under our other credit agreement. We may be unable to satisfy our debt obligations if the amounts due under the credit agreements are accelerated due to an event of default and such an acceleration event would result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We cannot be certain of the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility. Although we have a revolving line of credit for an amount up to $13 million, our ability to access that line of credit may be negatively impacted if the first lien lender suffers liquidity issues. In such an event, we may not be able to draw on all, or a substantial portion, of the available funds under our revolving line of credit. If we are unable to borrow the full amount of available credit under the revolving line of credit agreement or are unable to obtain future financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities, our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. We face significant competition which may negatively impact usage of our services or cause us to lose business opportunities. The market for our services is increasingly competitive. The widespread adoption of industry standards may make it easier for new market entrants and existing competitors to introduce services that compete against ours. Our competitors may use the same products and services in competition with us. With time and capital, it would be possible for competitors to replicate our services. We compete primarily on the basis of the functionality, breadth, quality and price of our services. Our current and potential competitors include relay providers such as Sorenson, CSDVRS, Snap, Hamilton and Viable. Sorenson has substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources than we do, and benefits from holding a substantial majority of the VRS market share, estimated at 75% of the VRS market. Additionally, Sorenson has greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers. Sorenson also controls an estimated 75% of the end-point video phones distributed in the consumer market which provides them a significant competitive advantage over other relay providers. 14 Table of Contents We may not have access to sufficient liquidity in the event holders of our Series A Preferred Stock elect to redeem their stock. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock may, at any time after January 10, 2013, elect to redeem their Series A Preferred Stock. If such holders elect to redeem their Series A Preferred Stock on or after January 10, 2013, we would be required to pay cash for such shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the Series A Preferred Stock issue price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock. We cannot be certain that we will be sufficiently liquid to satisfy our potential obligation to redeem such Series A Preferred Stock. Even if we had sufficient cash to satisfy our redemption obligations, such a redemption could result in the depletion of our cash, which could reduce our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. If the growth of the VRS market is less than what we anticipate, our financial results could be adversely affected. We anticipate significant growth in the VRS market, which currently represents the fastest growing form of relay service. If actual growth in this market is less than what we anticipate, our financial results could be adversely affected. If we cannot attract and retain interpreters, our ability to provide VRS could be adversely affected. The success of our VRS business depends on the availability of highly specialized interpreters. To the extent we are not able to attract and retain these interpreters, our ability to provide VRS, and community interpreting, could be adversely affected. We have historically incurred losses and these losses will continue in the foreseeable future. The Company has never earned a profit. We had net losses applicable to common stockholders of $8.2 million, $3.8 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. While we believe the acquisitions of Verizons TRS division, HOVRS and SLA and VLI will enable us to achieve scale in IP relay, VRS and community interpreting in a quicker-to-market and more cost effective manner than would be the case to grow these businesses organically, we can give no assurance that we will attain the type of revenue enhancements and cost savings necessary to achieve or sustain our revenue or profit goals. Failure to achieve or sustain our revenue or profit goals would adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to achieve or sustain our revenue and profit goals depends on the factors specified elsewhere in Risk Factors as well as on a number of factors outside of our control, including the extent to which:  our competitors announce and develop or, to the extent permitted by applicable regulations, lower the prices of, competing services;  The Federal Communications Commission materially reduces the per-minute reimbursement rates for relay services. As a result, we may not be able to increase revenue or achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We may be unable to execute our business strategy. Our business strategy is centered on the pursuit of certain priorities, centered on the offering of services to deaf or hard of hearing customers. These priorities and the principal risks associated with each priority include:  Development and marketing of new communications services and products, including branded Internet Protocol and Video Relay Services and related hardware. To remain competitive in our primary marketing areas, we must continue to offer innovative products and services. We will be limited in the 15 Table of Contents extent to which we can focus upon technological development by capital constraints, by the time that it takes to commercialize product and service concepts and by the steps that may be taken by our competitors. In our rapidly changing environment, developments that appear to present significant advantages may become more broadly available or surpassed before we are able to benefit from our development efforts. In recent years, our shortage of liquidity has required us to reduce the amount of resources devoted to marketing.  Providing superior customer experience using in-house and outsourced support functions. Our business model will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to offer a superior relay service user experience and customer support to the users of our relay services with high quality transmissions and highly competent communications assistants handling their calls. To the extent we rely on third party technologies and interpreters, the user experience with our services is highly dependent on their respective performance. In the past, capital constraints have limited our customer support functions. If we do not respond effectively to these risks, our business could be significantly and adversely affected. We may need additional funds which, if available, could result in increased interest expenses or additional dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are needed and are not available, our business could be negatively impacted. If we continue to operate unprofitably, if unanticipated contingencies arise or if new business opportunities are presented to us, it will be necessary for us to raise additional capital either through public or private equity or debt financing to primarily finance the execution of our anticipated strategic initiatives. If our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate regarding new lines of business within our target market, timeliness and effectiveness of implementation of new services we expect to offer, and/or weakness or lack of appreciable growth in our core business, we may be required to seek additional capital. As a result of the acquisitions of Verizons TRS division and HOVRS, control of the Company is concentrated in Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and its affiliates and certain former stockholders of HOVRS, who own in the aggregate, assuming all of the Companys outstanding Series A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock as of December 31, 2008, approximately 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. If funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then-current stockholders will be reduced further and the holders of new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. If additional funds are raised through a bank credit facility or the issuance of debt securities, the holder of such indebtedness would have rights senior to the rights of common stockholders and the terms of such indebtedness could impose restrictions on our operations. If we need to raise additional funds, we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us, or at all. If additional capital is required but is not available on acceptable terms or at all, we may be required to sell or otherwise dispose of portions of our business in order to sustain our operations and implement our new business plan. We may not be able to effect such sales on satisfactory terms, or at all. We may acquire or make investments in companies or technologies that could cause loss of value to our stockholders and disruption of our business. Subject to our capital constraints, we intend to continue to explore opportunities to acquire companies or technologies in the future, principally as enhancements to our offerings of products and services to our deaf and hard of hearing customers. Entering into an acquisition entails many risks, any of which could adversely affect our business, including:  failure to integrate the acquired assets and/or companies with our current business;  the price we pay may exceed the value we eventually realize; 16 Table of Contents  loss of share value to our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities as part or all of the purchase price;  potential loss of key employees from either our current business or the acquired business;  entering into markets in which we have little or no prior experience;  diversion of managements attention from other business concerns;  assumption of unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets; and  the business or technologies we acquire or in which we invest may have limited operating histories, may require substantial working capital, and may be subject to many of the same risks we are. We have limited resources and we may be unable to support effectively our operations. We must continue to develop and expand our systems and operations in order to remain competitive. Our need to continually innovate has placed, and we expect it to continue to place, significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. We may be unable to develop and expand our systems and operations or implement our business plan for one or more of the following reasons:  we may not be able to retain at reasonable compensation rates qualified engineers and other employees necessary to expand our capacity on a timely basis;  we may not be able to dedicate the capital necessary to effectively develop and expand our systems and operations; and  we may not be able to expand our customer service, billing and other related support systems. If we cannot manage our operations effectively, our business and operating results will suffer. Additionally, any failure on our part to develop and maintain our services if we experience rapid growth could significantly adversely affect our reputation and brand name which could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our services as well as to develop new products and services. We believe that our business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our current services and to develop new products and services. Our products and services will have to achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. As a result of the complexities inherent in our product and service offerings, major new product and services and product and service enhancements require long development and testing periods. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new products and services and product and service enhancements. Additionally, our new products and services and product and service enhancements may not achieve market acceptance. The Company plans include the launch of new products and we cannot be sure of its acceptance in the marketplace. The Companys plans include the launch of a new mobile video phone product in order to increase market penetration and thereby customer usage. We have no assurance that our mobile video phone will be accepted in the marketplace. If the product is not generally accepted, our ability to attract new service participants could be materially impacted. In addition, prior to the launch of our mobile video phone, we have not offered any hardware products. Such product offerings are sold with limited product warranties. If warranty claims are made by customers of our mobile video phone, it would increase the overall costs of such product offering to us and negatively affect our results of operations. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which warranty claims will be made. If the costs are too high or if we are unable to attract new service participants with the sale of the product, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. 17 Table of Contents We will depend on limited sources for the mobile video phone, which exposes us to risks related to product shortages or delays, as well as potential product quality issues, all of which could increase the cost of our products and reduce our operating profits. Our mobile video phone is available from limited outside supplier(s) due to unique component designs, as well as certain quality and performance requirements. If our mobile video phone becomes unavailable in sufficient quantities in the desired time periods, is discontinued or is available only on unsatisfactory terms, we would be required to purchase the product from other sources and may be required to redesign our product to use components which could delay production and delivery of our product. If production and delivery of our product is delayed such that we do not meet the agreed upon delivery dates of our customers, such delays could result in lost revenues due to customer cancellations, as well as potential financial penalties payable to our customers. Any such loss of revenue or financial penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our reliance on limited-source of supplier(s) also exposes us to quality control risks if the supplier experiences a failure in its production process or otherwise fails to meet our quality requirements. A failure by a single-source supplier to repair or replace defective products could force us to repair or replace a product utilizing replacement components. If we cannot obtain comparable replacements or redesign our products, we could lose customer orders or incur additional costs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change, our business could suffer. The communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, industry standards, customer needs and competition, as well as by frequent new product and service introductions. We must respond to technological changes affecting both our customers and suppliers. We may not be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new services that respond to technological changes, evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to accomplish all of the following in a timely and cost-effective manner:  effectively use and integrate new technologies;  continue to develop our technical expertise;  enhance our engineering and system design capabilities;  develop applications for new networks and services;  develop services that meet changing customer needs;  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes; and  advertise and market our services. We depend upon carriers networks. If we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks, our business will suffer. Our success partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on or offer our services over the networks of carriers and on the reliability and security of their systems. We depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and bug free service and would be adversely affected if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service. In addition, although we have some forward price protection in our existing agreements with certain carriers, we could be adversely affected if carriers were to increase the prices of their services significantly. We depend on retaining key personnel. The loss of our key employees and the inability to recruit talented new personnel could materially adversely affect our business. Due to the technical nature of our services and the dynamic market in which we compete, our performance depends on retaining and hiring certain key employees, including technically proficient personnel. Competitors 18 Table of Contents and others have recruited our employees in recent years as we have found it necessary to implement cost controls that have reduced the attractiveness of employment with us. An important part of our compensation to our key employees is in the form of stock option and/or restricted stock grants. The uncertainty associated with our stock price may make it difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel. Systems failures could harm our business by injuring our reputation or causing relay service users to use competitors services or lead to claims of liability for unsecured transmission of data. Our existing network services are dependent on near immediate, continuous feeds from various sources. The ability of our users to quickly access data requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our network carriers. Any significant disruption from our backup landline feeds could result in delays in our subscribers ability to receive such information. In addition, our systems could be disrupted by unauthorized access, computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions. A significant barrier to the growth of electronic commerce has been the need for secure and reliable transmission of confidential information. We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. If a third party were able to misappropriate our users personal or proprietary information or credit card information, we could be subject to claims, litigation or other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our business. There can be no assurance that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience a hardware or software failure. A failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data and, as a result, we may lose customers or face litigation that could materially adversely affect our business. An interruption in the supply of products and services that we obtain from third parties could cause a decline in sales of our services. In designing, developing and supporting our services, we rely on carriers, mobile device manufacturers, content providers and software providers. These suppliers may experience difficulty in supplying us products or services sufficient to meet our needs or they may terminate or fail to renew contracts for supplying us these products or services on terms we find acceptable. Any significant interruption in the supply of any of these products or services could cause a decline in sales of our services, unless and until we are able to replace the functionality provided by these products and services. We also depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. We rely primarily on trade secret laws, copyright law, trademark law, unfair competition law and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. To the extent that our technology is not adequately protected by intellectual property law, other companies could develop and market similar products or services which could materially adversely affect our business. We may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. The telecommunications and software industries are characterized by protection and vigorous enforcement of applicable intellectual property rights. As the number of participants in our market increases, the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us increases. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business. A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. 19 Table of Contents We may be subject to liability for transmitting certain information, and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from this liability. We may be subject to claims relating to information transmitted over systems we develop or operate. These claims could take the form of lawsuits for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other actions based on the nature and content of the materials. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and, as a result, period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors. These factors include:  the demand for and market acceptance of our services;  downward price adjustments by our competitors on services they offer that are similar to ours;  changes in the mix of services sold by our competitors;  technical difficulties or network downtime;  the ability to meet any increased technological demands of our customers; and  economic conditions specific to our industry. Therefore, our operating results for any particular quarter may differ materially from our expectations or those of security analysts and may not be indicative of future operating results. The failure to meet expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we fail to manage growth effectively, our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results. If we are successful in implementing our business plan and experience growth in our business, it will be necessary for us to expand our workforce and to train, motivate and manage additional employees and/or contractors as the need for additional personnel arises. Our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. Any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are vulnerable to circumstances outside of our control which could seriously disrupt our business. Our software, as well as any ancillary hardware, is vulnerable to damage or interruption from:  fire, flood, and other natural disasters;  power loss, computer systems failures, Internet and telecommunications or data network failure, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation, and similar events; and  computer viruses. Any disruption in the operation of our software, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such software, or our failure to continue to effectively modify and upgrade such software could interrupt our operations or interfere with our ability to provide service to our customers, which could result in reduced sales and affect our operations and financial performance. 20 Table of Contents Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting in all annual reports. This report contains, among other things, a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. In addition, commencing with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2009, we must obtain an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) provides a framework for companies to assess and improve their internal control systems. Auditing Standard No. 5 issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board provides the professional standards and related performance guidance for auditors to report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and some of the judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation. Therefore, managements report on our internal control over financial reporting may be difficult to prepare, and our auditors may not agree with managements assessment. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, management will not be able to assert its internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to attest that managements report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our business and the market price of our Common Stock. Risks Particular To Our Industry The market for our services is new and highly uncertain. The market for communications services serving deaf and hard-of-hearing persons has grown rapidly in recent years and the number and variety of competitive services is significant. Maintaining FCC certification has a material impact on our financial results. Current barriers to market acceptance of these services include cost, reliability, functionality and ease of use. Based on these factors and competitive aspects of the market, we cannot be certain of initial or continuing market acceptance of our services. If the market for our services does not grow or grows slower than we currently anticipate, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Laws and regulations that impact our industry could materially adversely affect our business. As described elsewhere in Risk Factors, aspects of our relay business are subject to direct regulation and decisions by the FCC which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, the carriers who supply us with network access are subject to regulation by the FCC and regulations that affect them could materially adversely affect our business. Our business could suffer significantly depending on the extent to which our activities or those of our customers or suppliers are regulated. In particular, the FCC issued an order requiring relay service providers to provide appropriate call routing for emergency calls (E911), although we have taken significant efforts to comply with the elements of the E911 order and believe that we are within compliance, if the FCC determines that we have not fully complied with the order and if we are thereafter unable to comply with further requests by the FCC, we may be subject to materially adverse FCC action. In addition, the FCCs November 19, 2007 declaratory ruling may be interpreted to prohibit some or all of our marketing activities and direct customer contact. On March 17, 2008, we filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging this 21 Table of Contents declaratory ruling. However, if our challenge is unsuccessful, our potential inability to market our services or to contact our customers could materially adversely affect our revenues. Additionally, we are currently undergoing a regulatory investigation by the FCC. Although the investigation is a routine investigation conducted by the FCC periodically, such investigation could result in the imposition of fines. Such investigation could also result in restrictions on our ability to participate in the reimbursement program through the TRS fund. We may also be forced to spend resources on compliance with any orders that are the result of such an investigation. The imposition of fines, restrictions on our ability to participate in reimbursement programs or the creation of compliance programs necessary to satisfy the FCC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We currently do not collect sales or other taxes with respect to the sale of services or products in states and countries where we believe we are not required to do so. We do collect sales and other taxes in the State in which we have an office and are required by law to do so. One or more jurisdictions have sought to impose sales other tax obligations on companies that engage in online commerce within their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions that we should collect sales or other taxes on our products and services, or remit payment of sales and other taxes for prior periods, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any new legislation or regulation that may be adopted by the United States Congress to regulate the Internet, or the application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third party development of similar technologies. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our technologies or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. We also rely on certain technologies that we license from third parties and these third party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially attractive terms. The loss of the ability to use certain technology or intellectual property could require us to obtain the rights to use substitute technology, which could be more expense or offer lower quality or performance, and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Third parties could claim infringement by us with respect to current or future technology. We expect that we and other participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows. Any such claim, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service or installation interruptions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Risks Particular to Stock Price Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. We expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low. In addition, due to the technology-intensive and emerging nature of our business, the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of factors, including:  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; 22 Table of Contents  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry; or  general market or economic conditions. This risk may be heightened because our industry is new and evolving, characterized by rapid technological change and susceptible to the introduction of new competing technologies or competitors. In addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Volatility in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action litigation. This type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. As mentioned elsewhere under Risk Factors, there has been increased volatility in the capital markets, and we cannot predict the effect such volatility, if it continues or increases, will have on our stock price. Ownership of our common stock is concentrated in a few holders who are in a position to control substantially all significant corporate transactions we may consider. As a result of the acquisitions of Verizons TRS division and HOVRS, control of the Company is concentrated in Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. and its affiliates and certain former stockholders of HOVRS, who own in the aggregate, assuming all of the Companys outstanding Series A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock as of December 31, 2008, approximately 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. As a result of their stock ownership, these stockholders are in a position to control substantially all significant corporate transactions we may consider in the future. Shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are subject to anti-dilution rights that could increase the concentration of the ownership of our common stock. Pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, our Series A Preferred Stock has certain anti-dilution protections. Pursuant to these protections, the number of shares of common stock that the Series A Preferred Stock may convert into will increase in the event that we issue stock at a price lower than the original price of the Series A Preferred Stock in certain circumstances. If the number of shares of common stock into which the Series A Preferred Stock may convert increases, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will control an increased percentage of our voting stock and will be in an even greater position to control significant corporate actions. Our ability to issue additional shares of preferred stock and common stock in the future may be construed as having an anti-takeover effect. The issuance in the future of additional authorized shares of preferred stock or common stock, which our restated certificate of incorporation permits us to do, may have the effect of diluting the earnings per share and book value per share, as well as the stock ownership and voting rights, of the currently outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, the existence of authorized, but unissued, shares of our preferred stock and common stock may be construed as having an anti-takeover effect. We could, subject to the boards fiduciary duties and applicable law, issue such authorized shares to purchasers who might oppose a hostile takeover bid. Such a use of these additional authorized shares could render more difficult, or discourage, an attempt to acquire control of us through a transaction opposed by the board. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities and intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying 23 Table of Contents any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock receive cumulative dividends. To the extent that such dividends are not paid in cash to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, further dilution may occur to our holders of common stock upon the conversion of the accrued and unpaid dividends into shares of common stock.
