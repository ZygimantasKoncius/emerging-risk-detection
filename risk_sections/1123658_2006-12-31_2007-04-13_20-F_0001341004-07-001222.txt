IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORS Not applicable. ITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected income statement data and cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2005 and 2006, presented in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) section, have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. The selected income statement data and cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and the selected balance sheet data as of December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, presented in IFRS section, are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included elsewhere in this annual report and financial statements of the acquired businesses described below. We acquired from Sinopec Group Company the operations of Sinopec Group Maoming Petrochemical Company (Sinopec Maoming), Xi'an Petrochemical Main Factory (Xi'an Petrochemical) and Tahe Oilfield Petrochemical Factory (Tahe Petrochemical) in 2003, the operations of Sinopec Group Tianjin Petrochemical Company, Sinopec Group Luoyang Petrochemical General Plant, Zhongyuan Petrochemical Company Limited, Sinopec Group Guangzhou Petrochemical General Plant and certain catalyst plants (collectively, Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets) in 2004, and the equity interest in Sinopec Hainan Refining and Chemical Company Limited (Sinopec Hainan) and certain oil and gas production companies (Oil Production Plants) in 2006. As we and these companies are under the common control of Sinopec Group Company, our acquisitions are considered as "combination of entities under common control" which are accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and related liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and the results of operation of these companies on a combined basis. Moreover, the selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements together with accompanying notes and "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" included elsewhere in this annual report. Unless otherwise indicated, our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. IFRS vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or US GAAP. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements. 4 Years Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------------------------------- 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 ------------ ------------ ----------- ------------- ------------ RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions, except per share and per ADS data) Income Statement Data(1): IFRS Consolidated results Operating revenues........................ 350,213 449,168 619,915 823,272 1,071,402 Other income.............................. - - - 9,415 5,000 Purchased crude oil, products and operating supplies and expenses.........

Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and results of operation of these acquired companies on a combined basis. The considerations for these acquisitions were treated as equity transactions.

CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. D. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Sinopec Corp. We rely heavily on outside suppliers for crude oil and other raw materials, and we may not be able to pass on all increases in our crude oil costs and may even experience disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil and other raw materials. We currently consume large amount of crude oil and other raw materials to manufacture our refined products and petrochemical products. In 2006, approximately 80% of the crude oil required for our refinery business was sourced from outside suppliers. In addition, our development will leave us no choice but to source an increasing amount of crude oil from outside suppliers. While we try to match price increases in products produced by us with corresponding crude oil price increases, our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers is dependent on international and domestic market conditions as well as the PRC government price control over refined petroleum products. For example, crude oil price fluctuated at a historically high level in the past three years, but we were not able to fully pass the increased material cost to our customers, in part due to the government's price control over certain refined petroleum products including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Crude oil price began to decline since the later part of 2006 and may fluctuate in 2007 and the years beyond. Although it was reported that new petroleum products price-setting mechanism had been formulated by the relevant government authority, we cannot predict when the revised price-setting mechanism will be fully implemented, and if implemented, to what extent the new price-setting mechanism will allow us to pass our increased crude oil costs to our refined petroleum products customers. Since we purchase a significant portion of our crude oil and other feedstock requirements from outside suppliers located in different countries and areas in the world, we are subject to the political, geographical and economic risks associated with these countries and areas. If one or more of our supply contracts were terminated or disrupted due to any natural disasters or political events, it is possible that we would be unable to find sufficient alternative sources of supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 7 Our continued business success depends in part on our ability to replace reserves and develop newly discovered reserves. Our ability to achieve our growth objectives is dependent in part on our level of success in discovering or acquiring additional oil and natural gas reserves and further exploring our current reserve base. Our exploration and development activities for additional reserves expose us to inherent risks associated with drilling, including the risk that no economically productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. Without reserve additions through further exploration and development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time as our reserves will eventually become depleted. Exploring for, developing and acquiring reserves is highly risky and capital intensive. If these activities are unsuccessful and we do not acquire properties containing proved reserves, our total proved reserves will decline, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We face strong competition from domestic and foreign competitors. Among our competitors, some are major integrated petroleum and petrochemical companies within and outside the PRC, which have recently become more significant participants in the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. On December 4, 2006, Ministry of Commerce of the PRC promulgated the "Administrative Rules for Crude Oil Market" and "Administrative Rules for Refined Petroleum Products Market" to open the wholesale market of crude oil and refined petroleum products to new market entrants. As a result, we expect to face more competition in both crude oil and refined petroleum products. We believe such trend will continue. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The oil and natural gas reserves data in this annual report are only estimates, and our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may differ materially from these estimates. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, and in the timing of development expenditures and the projection of future rates of production. The reserve data set forth in this annual report represent estimates only. Adverse changes in economic conditions may render it uneconomical to develop certain reserves. Our actual production, revenues, taxes and fees payable and development and operating expenditures with respect to our reserves may likely vary from these estimates. The reliability of reserves estimates depends on: o the quality and quantity of technical and economic data; o the prevailing oil and gas prices applicable to our production; o the production performance of the reservoirs; o extensive engineering judgments; and o consistency in the PRC government's oil policies. In addition, new drilling, testing and production following the estimates may cause substantial upward or downward revisions in the estimates. Furthermore, the discounted future cash flow calculated by applying the 10% discount rate, which was included in "Consolidated Financial Statements-Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)" following Item 19, may not represent the actual net present value of the relevant cash flow. Related party transactions; non-competition; conflicts of interest. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Group Company, which provides to us a number of services, including, but not limited to, ancillary supply, engineering, maintenance, transport, educational and community services. The nature of our transactions with Sinopec Group Company is governed by a number of service and other contracts between Sinopec Group Company and us. In addition, Sinopec Group Company has interests in businesses which compete or are likely 8 to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. We and Sinopec Group Company have entered into a non-competition agreement whereby Sinopec Group Company has agreed to refrain from operating businesses which compete or could compete with us in any of our domestic or international markets; grant us an option to purchase Sinopec Group Company's operations that compete or could compete with our businesses; operate its sales enterprises and service stations in a manner uniform to our sales and service operations; and appoint us as sales agent for certain of its products which compete or could compete with our products. Notwithstanding the foregoing contractual arrangements, because Sinopec Group Company is our dominant shareholder and the interests of the Sinopec Group Company may conflict with our own interests, Sinopec Group Company or any of its members may take actions that favor its interests or other subsidiaries' interests over ours. In addition, while we and Sinopec Group Company have entered into agreements which generally provide that these services provided by Sinopec Group Company will be priced on terms at least as favorable to us as ordinary commercial terms, we have limited or no practical alternative source of supply for some of these services, utilities, materials and equipment at reasonable cost. Moreover, the current terms in the agreements with respect to these services, utilities, materials and equipment may be subject to change when we renew these agreements with Sinopec Group Company. Our financing costs are subject to change in interest rates Changes in interest rates have affected and will continue to affect our financing costs and, ultimately, our results of operations. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) raised the benchmark one-year lending rates from 5.31% to 5.58% in October 2004 and had further raised the benchmark one-year lending rate three times since October 2004 to 6.39%, each time by 27 basis points. The increased lending rate drives up the cost of bank borrowings. Interest expenses (excluding capitalized interest) in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were RMB 4,583 million, RMB 5,926 million and RMB 7,437 million, respectively. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain bank loans or renew existing credit facilities in the future on reasonable terms or at all, nor can we assure that the PBOC will not further raise the lending rates, or that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected as a result. Risks Relating to the Petroleum and Petrochemical Industry Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. As an integrated petroleum and petrochemical company, we are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit: o the imposition of fees for the discharge of waste substances; o the levy of fines and payments for damages for serious environmental offenses; and o the government, at its discretion, to close any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste water, gas and solid waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We have established a system to treat waste materials to prevent and reduce pollution and believe that our operations substantially comply with all applicable PRC environmental laws and regulations as they have been previously interpreted and enforced. The PRC government has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards, which, in turn, would require us to incur additional expenditures on environmental matters. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. Most of our revenues are attributable to sales of refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, and certain businesses and related products have historically been cyclical and sensitive to the availability and prices of feedstock and general economic conditions, such as changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, 9 prices andavailability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand. With the further reduction of tariffs and other import restrictions in the PRC, many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of global markets. While we are a company integrated with upstream, midstream and downstream operations, it can help us reduce the effects of industry cycles only to a limited extent. Our business faces operation risks and natural disasters that may cause significant property damages, personal injuries and interruption of operations, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all the financial losses incurred by us. Exploring for, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas and producing and transporting refined and petrochemical products involve a number of operating hazards. For example, we handle many highly flammable, explosive, poisonous and harmful materials and operate many facilities under high pressure and high temperatures. As with many other companies in the world which conduct similar businesses, we have experienced accidents that have caused property damages and personal injuries and we cannot assure you that these industry-related accidents will not occur in the future. In addition, significant operating hazards and natural disasters may cause interruption to our operations as well as property or environmental damages, and each of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the financial losses caused by the operation risks and natural disasters. We maintain insurance coverage with Sinopec Group Company on our property, plant, equipment and inventory. The amount of coverage is determined on the basis of the historical value of the covered fixed assets and, with respect to inventory, twice each year on the basis of the average month-end inventory value of the most recent six months. The amount of our insurance coverage may be less than the replacement cost of the covered properties and may not be sufficient to cover all our financial losses. Furthermore, we do not carry any business interruption insurance or third party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injuries, property or environmental damages arising from accidents on our properties or relating to our operations other than third party liability insurance with respect to certain transportation vehicles. Losses incurred or payments required to be made by us, which are not fully insured, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to the PRC Government regulations may limit our activities and affect our business operations. The PRC government, though gradually liberalizing its regulation of petroleum and petrochemical industry, continues to exercise a certain degree of control over the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China by, among other measures: o licensing the right to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas; o publishing from time to time guidance prices for natural gas and refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel; o assessing taxes and fees payable, such as the recently imposed special levy on revenues generated from sales of domestically produced crude oil when the realized price exceeds US$40 per barrel as well as the expansion of the scope of consumption tax for petroleum products; o setting import and export quotas and procedures for crude oil and refined petroleum products; and o setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. 10 Some of our development plans require compliance with state policies and regulatory confirmation and registration. We are currently engaged in a number of construction, renovation and expansion projects. Some of our large construction, renovation and expansion projects are subject to governmental confirmation and registration. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including when we received the required confirmation and registration from relevant PRC government authorities and the general economic conditions in China. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not confirmed or registered, or not confirmed or registered in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Government control of currency conversion and exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. A portion of such revenues will need to be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency needs, which include, among other things: o import of crude oil and other materials; o debt service on foreign currency-denominated debt; o purchases of imported equipment; and o payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares (including ADS) . The existing foreign exchange regulations have significantly reduced government foreign exchange controls for transactions under the current account, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and payment of dividends. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, or to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures. The PRC government has stated publicly that it intends to make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, we cannot predict whether the PRC government will continue its existing foreign exchange policy and when the PRC government will allow free conversion of Renminbi. The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including US dollars, has historically been set by the PBOC. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the US dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy resulted initially in an approximately 2.0% appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar. Since the adoption of this new policy, the value of Renminbi against the US dollar has fluctuated on a daily basis within narrow ranges, but overall has further strengthened against the US dollar. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to further liberalize its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar. As we outsource a significant portion of our crude oil requirement which are benchmarked to US dollar-denominated international prices, fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollars and certain other foreign currencies may affect our crude oil costs. Enforcement of shareholder rights; mandatory arbitration. Currently, the primary sources of shareholder rights are our articles of association, the PRC Company Law and the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which, among other things, impose certain standards of conduct, fairness and disclosure on us, our directors and our controlling shareholder. In general, their provisions for protection of shareholder's rights and access to information are different from those applicable to companies incorporated in the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. In addition, the mechanism for enforcement of rights under the corporate framework to which we are subject may also be relatively undeveloped and untested. To our knowledge, there has not been any published report of judicial enforcement in the PRC by 11 H share shareholders of their rights under constituent documents of joint stock limited companies or the PRC Company Law or in the application or interpretation of the PRC or Hong Kong regulatory provisions applicable to PRC joint stock limited companies. We cannot assure you that our shareholders will enjoy protections that they may be entitled in other jurisdictions. China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom or most other Western countries, and therefore recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may not be assured. Our articles of association as well as the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange provide that most disputes between holders of H shares and us, our directors, supervisors, officers or holders of domestic shares, arising out of the articles of association or the PRC Company Law concerning the affairs of our company or with respect to the transfer of our shares, are to be resolved through arbitration by arbitration organizations in Hong Kong or China, rather than through a court of law. On June 18, 1999, an arrangement was made between Hong Kong and the PRC for the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards. This new arrangement was approved by the Supreme People's Court of the PRC and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000. So far as we are aware, no action has been brought in China by any shareholder to enforce an arbitral award, and we are uncertain as to the outcome of any action brought in China to enforce an arbitral award granted to shareholders.
