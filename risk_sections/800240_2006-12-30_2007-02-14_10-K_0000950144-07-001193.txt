Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and our company could materially impact our future performance and results. We have provided below a list of these risk factors that should be reviewed when considering our securities. These are not all the risks we face, and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations. Competition: We compete with a variety of retailers, dealers, distributors, contract stationers, direct marketers and internet operators throughout our worldwide operations. This is a highly competitive marketplace that includes such retail competitors as office supply stores, warehouse clubs, computer and electronics stores, mass merchant retailers, local merchants, grocery and drug-store chains as well as other competitors including direct mail and internet merchants, contract stationers, and direct manufacturers. Our competitors may be local, regional, national or international. Further, competition may come from highly-specialized low-cost merchants, including ink refill stores and kiosks, original equipment manufacturers, concentrated direct marketing channels or well-funded and broad-based enterprises. There is a possibility that any or all of these competitors could become more aggressive in the future, thereby increasing the number and breadth of our competitors. In recent years, new and well-funded competitors have begun competing in certain aspects of our business. For example, two major common carriers of goods have retail outlets that allow them to compete directly for copy, printing, packaging and shipping business, and offer products and services similar to ones we offer. While they do not yet offer the breadth of products that we offer, they are extremely competitive in the areas of package shipping and copy and print centers. Recently, the so-called warehouse clubs have expanded upon their in-store offerings by adding catalog and internet sales channels, offering a broad assortment of office products for sale on a direct delivery basis. In order to achieve and maintain expected profitability levels in our three operating divisions, we must continue to grow by adding new customers and taking market share from competitors, while maintaining service levels, and aggressive pricing necessary to retain existing customers. If we fail to adequately address and respond to these pressures in both North America and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Execution of Expansion Plans: We plan to open approximately 150 stores in the United States and Canada and approximately 20 stores in our International Division during 2007. Circumstances outside our control could negatively impact these anticipated store openings. We cannot determine with certainty whether our new store openings, including some newly sized or formatted stores or retail concepts, will be successful. The failure to expand by successfully opening new stores as planned, or the failure of a significant number of these stores to perform as planned, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Cannibalization of Sales in Existing Office Depot Stores: As we expand the number of our stores in existing markets, pursuing a fill-in strategy that is both offensive and defensive in nature, sales in our existing stores may suffer from cannibalization (as customers of our existing stores begin shopping at our own new stores). Extensive cannibalization of existing stores, as we open new stores, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Costs of Remodeling and Re-merchandising Stores: Remodeling and re-merchandising our stores is a necessary aspect of maintaining a fresh and appealing image to our customers. The expenses associated with such activities could have a significant negative impact on our future earnings. Business lost during remodeling periods, because of customer inconvenience, or closed periods for individual stores may not be recovered or successfully redirected to other stores in the area. Our growth, through both store openings and possible acquisitions, may continue to require the expansion and upgrading of our information, operational and financial systems, as well as necessitate the hiring of new store associates at all levels. If we are unsuccessful in achieving an acceptable ROI on this design, unsuccessful at hiring the right associates, or unsuccessful at implementing appropriate systems, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. International Activity: We may enter additional international markets as attractive opportunities arise. Such entries could take the form of start-up ventures, acquisitions of stock or assets or joint ventures or licensing arrangements. Already this year, we have entered three new international markets and increased our stake in a fourth country to a majority ownership position. Internationally, we face such risks as foreign currency fluctuations, unstable political and economic conditions, and, because some of our foreign operations are not wholly owned, the potential for compromised operating control in certain countries. In addition, the business cultures in certain areas of the world are different than those that prevail in the United States, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage against other companies that do not have to comply with standards of financial controls or business integrity that Office Depot is committed to maintaining as a U.S. publicly traded company and SEC registrant. Our results may continue to be affected by all of these factors. All of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. 9 Table of Contents Global Sourcing of Products/Private Brand: In recent years, we have substantially increased the number and types of products that we sell under our private brands. We currently offer general office supplies, computer supplies, business machines and related supplies, and office furniture under various labels, including Office Depot®, Office Depot ValueTM, Viking Office Products®, NicedayTM, Foray®, Ativa®, Break EscapesTM, WorklifeTM and Christopher LowellTM. Sources of supply may prove to be unreliable, or the quality of the globally sourced products may vary from our expectations. We have recently opened our own sourcing office in China and are reducing our reliance on the use of third-party trading companies. While this may improve our cost structure in terms of global sourcing, it also makes our Company more accountable for relationships with the factories and other sources of private branded product and increases our risks associated with doing business in that region of the world. Economic and civil unrest in areas of the world where we source such products, as well as shipping and dockage issues could adversely impact the availability or cost of such products, or both. Moreover, as we seek indemnities from the manufacturers of these products, the uncertainty of realization of any such indemnity and the lack of understanding of U.S. product liability laws in certain parts of the Far East make it more likely that we may have to respond to claims or complaints from our customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products. Because of the limited number of ports through which goods may be imported into the United States (located primarily on the West Coast), we are subject to potential disruption of our supplies of goods for resale due to labor unrest, security issues or natural disasters affecting any or all of these ports. Finally, as a significant importer of manufactured goods from foreign countries, we are vulnerable to security concerns, labor unrest and other factors that may affect the availability and reliability of ports of entry for the products that we source. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Product Availability: In addition to selling our private brand merchandise, we are a reseller of other manufacturers branded items and are thereby dependent on the availability and pricing of key products, including ink, toner, paper and technology products, to name a few. As a reseller, we cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products we offer for sale. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect our sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. Further, we cannot control the cost of manufacturers products and cost increases must either be passed along to our customers or result in an erosion of our earnings. Failure to identify desirable products and make them available to our customers when desired and at attractive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Possible Business Disruption Due to Weather: Weather conditions may affect any business, especially retail businesses, including snow storms in the northern states, high winds and heavy rain. Because of our heavy concentration in the southern United States (including Florida and the Gulf Coast) our Company may be more susceptible than some others to the effects of tropical weather disturbances. During 2004 and 2005, we sustained disruption to our businesses in the United States due to the number and severity of weather events in the Southeastern United States, including record numbers of hurricanes. While we have been able to recover quickly from these events during the past two years, the long-range weather forecast calls for higher than normal tropical storm activity, especially in the Southeastern United States for a number of years into the future. It is impossible to know whether these storms will occur as forecasted, or the location or severity of such storms. During late 2006 and early 2007, we also sustained business disruption due to ice and snow conditions in the Midwest and Southwest, in areas that also have large concentrations of our business activities, resulting in supply chain constraints and other disruptions in our businesses. We believe that we have taken reasonable precautions to prepare for such weather-related events, but there is no assurance that our precautions will be adequate to deal with such events in the future. If these events occur in the future (as they almost certainly will), and if they should impact areas in which we have concentrations of retail stores or distribution facilities, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. New Systems and Technology: We frequently modify our systems and technology to increase productivity and efficiency. We are undertaking certain system enhancements and conversions that, if not done properly, could divert the attention of our workforce during development and implementation and constrain for some time our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand. Also, when implemented, the systems and technology may not provide the benefits anticipated and could add costs and complications to our ongoing operations. A failure to effectively convert to these systems or to realize the intended efficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Labor Costs: We are heavily dependent on our labor force to identify new customers and provide desired products and services to existing customers. We attempt to attract and retain an appropriate level of personnel in both field operations and corporate functions. Our compensation packages are designed to provide benefits commensurate with our level of expected service. However, as a retailer, we face the challenge of filling many positions at wage scales that are appropriate to the industry and competitive factors. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to closely monitor compliance with labor laws and regulations, many of which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and can be difficult to adhere to as precisely as some enforcement officials and litigants insist the Company should do. This has added to our labor costs in some locales as we have had to add personnel to monitor and track compliance with these sometimes arcane rules and regulations that impact retailers in particular. As a result of these and other factors, we face many external risks and internal factors in meeting our labor needs, including competition for qualified personnel, overall unemployment levels, works councils (in our international locations), prevailing wage rates, as well as rising employee benefit costs, including insurance costs and compensation programs. We also engage third parties in some of our processes such as delivery and transaction processing and these providers may face similar issues. Changes in any of these factors, including especially a shortage of available workforce in the areas in which we operate, could interfere with our ability to adequately provide services to customers and result in increasing our labor costs. Any failure to meet increasing demands on securing our workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. 10 Table of Contents Operating Costs: We operate a large network of stores and delivery centers around the globe. As such, we purchase significant amounts of fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers. We also incur significant shipping costs to bring products from overseas producers to our distribution systems. The underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity have been volatile in recent periods and disruptions in availability of fuel could cause our operating costs to rise significantly. Additionally, we rely on predictable and available energy costs to light our stores and operate our equipment. Increases in any of the components of energy costs could have an adverse impact on our earnings, as well as our ability to satisfy our customers in a cost effective manner. Any of these factors that could impact the availability or cost of our energy resources could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Possible Changes to Our Global Tax Rate: Our company is a multi-national, multi-channel reseller of office products and services. As a result of our operations in many foreign countries, in addition to the United States, our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Depending upon the sources of our income, any agreements we may have with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, and the tax filing positions we take in various jurisdictions, our overall tax rate may be lower or higher than that of other companies or higher or lower than our tax rates have been in the past. At any given point in time, we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income likely to be generated in any given geography. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of our business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws in any of the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate or adverse outcomes from the tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax rate, which change could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Regulatory Environment: While all businesses are subject to regulatory matters relating to the conduct of their businesses, including consumer protection laws, advertising regulations, wage and hour regulations and the like, certain jurisdictions have taken a particularly aggressive stance with respect to such matters and have stepped up enforcement, including fines and other sanctions. The Company transacts substantial amounts of business in certain such jurisdictions, and to the extent that the Companys business locations are exposed to what might be termed an overly aggressive enforcement environment or legal or regulatory systems that authorize or encourage private parties to pursue relief under so-called private attorney general laws and similar authorizations for private parties to pursue enforcement of governmental laws and regulations, the resulting fines and exposure to third party liability (such as monetary recoveries and recoveries of attorneys fees) could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including the added cost of increased prophylactic measures that the Company may determine to be necessary to conduct business in such locales.
