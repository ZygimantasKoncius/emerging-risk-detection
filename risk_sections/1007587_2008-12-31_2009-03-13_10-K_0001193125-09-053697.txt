ITEM 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline. Our revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic turmoil and credit tightening. Worldwide economic conditions have recently experienced a significant downturn, including slower economic activity, tightened credit markets, inflation and deflation concerns, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, reduced or canceled capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns. These conditions make it difficult for businesses, governments and consumers to accurately forecast and plan future activities. Governments are experiencing significant declines in tax receipts, which may cause them to curtail spending significantly or reallocate funds away from defense programs. There can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the economy will remedy these problems. As a result of these and other factors, customers could slow or suspend spending on our products and services. We may also be forced to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would have a negative impact on our cash position, liquidity and financial condition. We cannot predict the timing, duration or ultimate impact of this downturn. We expect our business to be adversely impacted by this downturn. We have a history of variable operating results and may not be profitable in the future. Although we generated net income during 2006, 2007, and 2008 and in eighteen of the last twenty-four fiscal quarters, at times our profitability has fluctuated significantly on both a sequential and comparable quarter-to-quarter basis during 2007 and 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of $5.3 million. Our inventory levels increased 66% from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 and could require an inventory write-down if our inventory reduction and rebalancing efforts are ineffective. Our inventory level at December 31, 2008 increased 66% compared to the prior year. The increase was largely the result of two factors. First, commencing during the second quarter of 2008 we began to build up inventory levels of fiber optic gyro materials in anticipation of large orders for remote weapon stations and MK54 torpedo programs. Second, the dramatic weakening of the RV market commencing in the first half of the year, particularly during the second quarter, and the crisis of consumer confidence in the general economy during the second half of the year, caused precipitous declines in demand for our RV products and substantial reductions in demand for our marine consumer products. While shipments of fiber optic gyros for remote weapon stations are now underway, we anticipate that it will take several quarters to reduce other product inventories to more normal levels if the current weak level of demand continues. We currently anticipate to receive a large order for the MK54 torpedo program in June 2009, but there can be no assurance that the order will not be delayed or cancelled. As of December 31, 2008 we had approximately $0.7 million of inventory, primarily made up of raw materials for military products whose utilization will be dependent upon the receipt of additional sales orders in the future. If we do not receive such sales orders, and we are unable to redeploy the components of such inventory for other product sales, we may be required to record additional write-downs to inventory which would 11 Table of Contents negatively impact both gross margins and net income in the period when such write-downs are recorded. If our inventory reduction and rebalancing efforts are unsuccessful or take a very extended period of time, we may have to consider sizeable inventory reserves or write-downs to address potential excess and obsolete inventory, or our gross margins may fall below historical levels, which would adversely affect our financial results. Our net sales and operating results could decline due to the current recession or associated declines in consumer spending. Our operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions, which have worsened dramatically in recent periods. Net sales of our mobile communications products are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending, and demand for these products is likely to demonstrate slower growth than we anticipate or decline as a result of worsening regional and global economic conditions. Consumer spending tends to decline during recessionary periods and may decline at other times. For example, sales of our mobile satellite communications products declined approximately 17% from 2007 to 2008 in North America. Consumers may choose not to purchase our mobile communications products due to a perception that they are luxury items. As global and regional economic conditions change, including the general level of interest rates, fluctuating oil prices and demand for durable consumer products, demand for our products could be materially and adversely affected. Adverse economic conditions could result in financial difficulties or bankruptcy for any of our suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The significant downturn in worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening could present challenges to our suppliers, which could result in disruptions to our business, increase our costs, delay shipment of our products and impair our ability to generate and recognize revenue. To address their own business challenges, our suppliers may increase prices, reduce the availability of credit, require deposits or advance payments or take other actions that may impose a burden on us. They may also reduce production capacity, slow or delay delivery of products, face challenges meeting our specifications or otherwise fail to meet our requirements. In some cases, our suppliers may face bankruptcy. We may be required to identify, qualify and engage new suppliers, which would require time and the attention of management. Any of these events could impair our ability to deliver our products to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, cause us to breach our contractual commitments or result in the loss of customers. Shifts in our product sales mix toward our mobile communications products may continue to reduce our overall gross margins. Our mobile communications products historically have had lower product gross margins than our guidance and stabilization products. During 2006 and 2007, and the first three quarters of 2008, sales of our guidance and stabilization products either declined or grew at a substantially lower rate than our overall sales growth. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we experienced a significant increase in sales of our guidance and stabilization products, primarily due to an increase in our FOG and legacy navigation product sales. A continuing shift in our product sales mix toward mobile communications products would likely cause lower gross margins in the future. Competition may limit our ability to sell our mobile communications products and guidance and stabilization products. The mobile communications markets and defense navigation, guidance and stabilization markets in which we participate are very competitive, and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which could impair our ability to sell our products. For example, improvements in the performance of lower cost gyros could potentially jeopardize sales of our fiber optic gyros. In the guidance and stabilization markets, we compete primarily with Honeywell International Inc., Kearfott Guidance & Navigation Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Smiths Group plc, Tamam, and Fizoptica. 12 Table of Contents In the market for marine satellite TV equipment, we compete with NaviSystem Marine Electronic Systems Srl, King Controls, Cobham Sea Tel, Inc., Raymarine, and Intellian. In the market for maritime broadband service we compete with SeaMobile, CapRock, Schlumberger, Thrane & Thrane A/S, Ship Equip, Vizada, Stratos, and Cobham Sea Tel. In the marine market for satellite communications equipment, we compete with Cobham Sea Tel, Inc., Furuno Electric Co., Ltd., Globalstar LP, Iridium Satellite LLC, EMS and Japan Radio Company. In the market for land mobile satellite TV equipment, we compete with King Controls, MotoSAT, TracStar Systems, Inc., Winegard Company, and Sirius Satellite Radio. Among the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following:  many of our primary competitors are well-established companies that could have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do;  product improvements, new product developments or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of, and reduce demand for, our products;  new technology or market trends may disrupt or displace a need for our products; and  our competitors may have lower production costs than we do, which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions. The emergence of a competing small maritime VSAT antenna and complementary service or other, similar service could reduce the competitive advantage we believe we currently enjoy with our 24-inch diameter TracPhone V7 antenna and integrated mini-VSAT Broadband service. Our TracPhone V7 system offers customers a range of benefits due to its integrated design, hardware costs that are lower than existing maritime VSAT systems, and spread spectrum technology. We anticipate competition from companies like Cobham Sea Tel and MTN, both of which have recently announced their intent to offer similar systems and services. We also compete against companies like Sea Tel that offer established maritime VSAT service using antennas 1 meter in diameter or larger. In addition, other companies could replicate the distinguishing features of our TracPhone V7, which could potentially reduce the appeal of our solution and adversely affect sales. Moreover, consumers may choose other services such as Inmarsat Fleet or FleetBroadband for their global service coverage and potentially lower hardware costs despite higher service costs and slower data rates. Our ability to compete in the maritime airtime services market may be impaired if we are unable to expand the coverage of our mini-VSAT Broadband service to new regions. The TracPhone V7 and mini-VSAT Broadband service offer a range of benefits to mariners, especially in commercial markets, due to the smaller size antenna and faster, more affordable airtime. However, to support these customers, we need to expand the coverage areas of the mini-VSAT Broadband service, which is currently offered in the north Pacific Ocean, the Americas, Caribbean, North Atlantic, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. If we are unable to reach agreement with third-party satellite providers to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and its spread spectrum technology, our ability to support vessels and aeronautical applications globally will be at risk and reduce the attractiveness of the product and service to these customers. Customers for our fiber optic gyro products and TACNAV include the U.S. military and foreign governments, whose purchasing and delivery schedules and priorities are often unpredictable. We sell our fiber optic gyro systems as well as vehicle navigation products to U.S. and foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other manufacturers. These customers often use a 13 Table of Contents competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. Factors that affect their purchasing and delivery decisions include:  changes in modernization plans for military equipment;  changes in tactical navigation requirements;  global conflicts impacting troop deployment;  priorities for current battlefield operations;  allocation of funding for military programs;  new military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs;  sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict;  shifting response time and/or delays in the approval process associated with the export licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of our military products;  delays in military procurement schedules; and  delays in the testing and acceptance of our products, including delays resulting from changes in customer specifications. These factors can cause substantial fluctuations in sales of fiber optic gyros and TACNAV products from period to period. For example, sales of our TACNAV products declined from 2006 to 2007, but increased from 2007 to 2008. The Obama administration and the new Congress may change defense spending priorities, either in conjunction with the decision to commence troop withdrawals from Iraq or for other reasons. Moreover, government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience or decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options. Even under firm orders with government customers, funding must usually be appropriated in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract. The cancellation of or failure to fund orders for our products could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations. Sales of our fiber optic gyro systems and TACNAV products generally consist of a few large orders, and the delay or cancellation of a single order could substantially reduce our net sales. KVH products sold to customers in the defense industry are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to more than one million dollars. As a result, the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations. We continue to experience unanticipated delays in defense orders, which make our revenues and operating results less predictable. Because our guidance and stabilization products typically have relatively higher product gross margins than our mobile communications products, the loss of an order for guidance and stabilization products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. Only a few customers account for a substantial portion of our guidance and stabilization revenues, and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales. We derive a significant portion of our guidance and stabilization revenues from a small number of customers, including the U.S. Government. The loss of business from any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business. Since we are often awarded a contract as a subcontractor to a major defense supplier that is engaged in a competitive bidding process as prime contractor for a major weapons procurement program, our revenues depend significantly on the success of the prime contractors with which we align ourselves. 14 Table of Contents The market for mobile TV products for minivans, SUVs and other passenger vehicles has not developed as we originally expected it would, and our business in this market may never be a growth driver. The market for live TV in automobiles is still in a relatively early stage of development, and there are many alternative technologies that provide entertainment and communication capabilities to mobile users in automobiles. Historically, sales of the automotive TracVision system have generally been below our expectations. We believe the success of our low profile TracVision systems will depend upon consumers assessment of whether these products meet their expectations for performance, quality, price and design. For example, the TracVision A7 is designed for use on open roads in the continental United States where there is a clear view of the transmitting satellite in the southern sky, and it may not perform satisfactorily under other conditions. Among the factors that could affect the success of the low profile TracVision systems are:  the performance, price and availability of competing or alternative products and technology relative to the automotive TracVision;  the extent to which customers prefer live TV over recorded media;  the extent to which customers perceive mobile satellite TV services as a luxury or a preferred convenience;  the extent to which TracVision gains the acceptance of the automotive OEMs;  customers willingness to pay monthly fees for satellite television service in automobiles; and  the adoption of laws or regulations that restrict or ban television or other video technology in vehicles. Our mobile satellite products currently depend on satellite services provided by third parties, and any disruption in those services could adversely affect sales. Our satellite products include only the equipment necessary to receive satellite services; we do not broadcast satellite television programming or own the satellites to directly provide two-way satellite communications. We currently offer satellite television products compatible with the DIRECTV and DISH Network services in the United States, the ExpressVu service in Canada, the Sky Mexico service and various other regional services in other parts of the world. We rely on Inmarsat for satellite communications services for our mini-M, Fleet and FleetBroadband compatible TracPhone products. SES AMERICOM, Eutelsat, and SAT-GE currently provide the satellite network to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and our TracPhone V7. If customers become dissatisfied with the programming, pricing, service, availability or other aspects of any of these satellite services, or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason, we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our satellite products. There may be no alternative service provider available in a particular geographic area, and our technology may not be compatible with that of any alternative service provider that may be available. In addition, the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services, which could reduce the demand for, or customer satisfaction with, our products. We rely upon spread spectrum communications technology developed by ViaSat and fielded by third-party satellite providers to permit two-way broadband Internet via our 24-inch diameter TracPhone V7, and any disruption in the availability of this technology could adversely affect sales. Our mini-VSAT Broadband service relies on spread spectrum technology developed with ViaSat, Inc. for use with satellite networks controlled by SES AMERICOM, Eutelsat, and SAT-GE. Our TracPhone V7 two-way broadband satellite terminal combines our stabilized antenna technology with ViaSats ArcLight spread spectrum 15 Table of Contents mobile broadband technology, along with a new maritime version of ViaSats ArcLight spread spectrum modem. The ArcLight technology is also integrated within the satellite hubs that support this service. Sales of the TracPhone V7 and our mini-VSAT Broadband service could be disrupted if we fail to receive approval from regulatory authorities to provide our spread spectrum service in various countries our customers operate or if there were issues with the availability of the ArcLight maritime modems. We no longer have the right to continue offering mini-VSAT Broadband service using SES AMERICOMs satellite network on an exclusive basis in certain geographic markets because annual revenue targets were not reached during the first year; however, the contract is not terminable by either party because revenues in the first year of service did meet certain minimum goals. Under our agreement with SES AMERICOM, we cannot offer a mini-VSAT Broadband service utilizing technology that competes with SES AMERICOMs technology in areas where they offer service. If another party has or introduces technology superior to that of SES AMERICOM, our sales might suffer, and we would not be able to offer a service using that alternative technology. Investment in the global deployment of the mini-VSAT Broadband service will require significant capital investment and initial operating expenses that may not be recouped if we fail to meet the subscriber levels necessary to cover those costs on an ongoing basis. It is our intent to invest in and deploy the mini-VSAT Broadband network on a global basis in cooperation with ViaSat under the terms of a 10-year agreement announced in July 2008. As part of the coverage expansion, we have agreed to acquire satellite capacity from Ku-band satellite operators as well as purchase at least three new regional satellite hubs from ViaSat. During the deployment period, we expect to see a substantial increase in costs associated with the build out of the mini-VSAT Broadband global infrastructure and support capability. In the short term KVH and ViaSat will be covering the operational cost per transponder access until sufficient subscribers join the network and allow us to reach a breakeven point on our transponder cost, which may not occur. We currently estimate that, on average, it will require at least nine months to reach the breakeven point once the service is turned on for a new coverage region. However, should an insufficient number of subscribers activate within a region, our operations may continue below the breakeven level for a longer duration and adversely affect our operating results and cash levels. High fuel prices, high interest rates, tight credit availability and environmental concerns may adversely affect sales of our mobile communications products. Factors such as historically high fuel prices, interest rates, tight credit and environmental protection laws could continue to materially and adversely affect sales or use of larger vehicles and vessels for which our mobile satellite communications products are designed. Many customers finance their purchases of these vehicles and vessels, and higher interest rates and/or tightened credit availability would likely reduce demand for both these vehicles and vessels and our mobile communications products. Moreover, in the current credit markets financing for these purchases may be unavailable or more difficult to obtain. The increased cost of operating these vehicles and vessels is adversely affecting and may continue to adversely affect demand for our mobile satellite communications products. We may continue to increase the use of international suppliers to source components for our manufacturing operations, which could disrupt our business. Although we have historically manufactured and sourced raw materials for the majority of our products in the U.S., in order for us to compete with lower priced competitive products while also improving our profitability, we have found it desirable to source raw materials and manufactured components from foreign countries such as China and Mexico. Our increased reliance on foreign manufacturing and/or raw material supply has lengthened our supply chain and increased the risk that a disruption in that supply chain could have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial performance. 16 Table of Contents We have single dedicated manufacturing facilities for each of our mobile communications and guidance and stabilization product categories, and any significant disruption to a facility could impair our ability to deliver our products. We currently manufacture all of our mobile communications products at our headquarters in Middletown, Rhode Island, and the majority of our guidance and stabilization products at our facility in Tinley Park, Illinois. Some of our production processes are complex, and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of either production facility. For example, our production facilities use some specialized equipment that may take time to replace if they are damaged or become unusable for any reason. In that event, shipments would be delayed, which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. Finally, we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term. If short-term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. We depend on sole or limited source suppliers, and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost. We obtain many key components for our products from third-party suppliers, and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers. Any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply, which could take several weeks, months or longer and could increase our costs significantly. Suppliers might change or discontinue key components, which could require us to modify our product designs. For example, we have experienced changes in the chemicals used to coat our optical fiber, which changed its characteristics and thereby necessitated design modifications. In general, we do not have written long-term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders, which expose us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse. It is generally not our practice to carry significant inventories of product components, and this could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier. If we are required to use a new source of materials or components, it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability. Any failure to maintain and expand our third-party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile communications products. We market and sell our mobile communications products through an international network of independent retailers, chain stores and distributors, as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles. If we are unable to maintain or improve our distribution relationships, it could significantly limit our sales. In addition, our distribution partners may sell products of other companies, including competing products, and are not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products. If we are unable to improve our existing mobile communications and guidance and stabilization products and develop new, innovative products, our sales and market share may decline. The markets for mobile communications products and guidance and stabilization products are each characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards. If we fail to make innovations in our existing products and reduce the costs of our products, our market share may decline. Products using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could render our products obsolete. If our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a market or otherwise outperform our products, or are perceived by consumers as doing so, we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes. If we cannot effectively manage our growth, our business may suffer. We have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities. This growth placed a strain on our personnel, management, finan cial and other resources. If we grow more rapidly 17 Table of Contents than we anticipate and fail to manage that growth properly, we may incur unnecessary expenses, and the efficiency of our operations may decline. To manage any growth effectively, we must, among other things:  upgrade, expand or re-size our manufacturing facilities and capacity in a timely manner;  successfully attract, train, motivate and manage a larger number of employees for manufacturing, sales and customer support activities;  control higher inventory and working capital requirements; and  improve the efficiencies within our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems, and our procedures and controls. We may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations. To meet our growth objectives, we must attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could lead to a significant decline in net sales. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. Our success depends on the services of our executive officers and key employees. Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of Martin Kits van Heyningen, our co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board. If we lost the services of Mr. Kits van Heyningen, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. We also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and members of senior management to work effectively as a team. None of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or senior management members could impair our ability to manage our business effectively. Our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments. Historically, sales to customers outside the United States and Canada have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales. We have only one foreign sales office, which is located in Denmark, and we otherwise support our international sales from our operations in the United States. Our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have no infrastructure. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities, which may increase our costs and require significant management attention. These risks include:  technical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile communication products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world;  satisfaction of international regulatory requirements and delays and costs associated with procurement of any necessary licenses or permits;  restrictions on the sale of certain guidance and stabilization products to foreign military and government customers;  increased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages;  potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;  potentially longer sales cycles, which could slow our revenue growth from international sales; 18 Table of Contents  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;  losses arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and  economic and political instability in some international markets. Exports of certain guidance and stabilization products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and require a license from the U.S. Department of State prior to shipment. We must comply with the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Our products that have military or strategic applications are on the munitions list of the ITAR and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products, and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations. The length of time required by the licensing process can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restriction on the export of a product line or any amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales. Our business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology. Our ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents, our source code and our other proprietary technology. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us. Our patents could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages. Existing trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation. Furthermore, other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. Any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position, which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail. Also, we have delivered certain technical data and information to the U.S. government under procurement contracts, and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us. Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition. Our industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property rights of others. We do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. From time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. Any claim of 19 Table of Contents infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock. We have at times experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next. Our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall significantly. Our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons, including:  changes in demand for our mobile communications products and guidance and stabilization products;  the timing and size of individual orders from military customers;  the mix of products we sell;  our ability to manufacture, test and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, including the availability and timely delivery of components and subassemblies from our suppliers;  our success in winning competitions for orders;  the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors;  expense incurred in pursuing acquisitions, such as during the third quarter of 2006;  market and competitive pricing pressures;  general economic climate; and  seasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage. A large portion of our expenses, including expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, if our net sales decline or do not grow as much as we anticipate, we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins. Any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period. Our tax planning strategy involves assumptions that may cause our annual provision for income tax expense or benefit to fluctuate materially. Moreover, our tax planning strategy is based upon our ability to sell our manufacturing and corporate headquarters facility located in Middletown, Rhode Island, as may be necessary. We utilize a tax planning strategy as provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as a means of supporting the realizability of certain of our deferred tax assets. The strategy involves our ability to sell our Middletown, Rhode Island headquarters facility in order to generate taxable income for the sole purpose of utilizing our U.S. net operating tax loss carry-forwards before they expire. The determination of taxable income, and therefore supportable deferred tax asset value, is based upon the difference between the propertys estimated fair market value and our tax basis. Accordingly, the estimated net realizable value of our deferred tax asset is highly correlated to property values in and around the Middletown, Rhode 20 Table of Contents Island area and therefore subject to changes in property value and or assumptions used in the valuation process. This fair market value subjectivity may cause us to record significant increases or decreases to our deferred tax assets during the year. The strategy represents an action that we ordinarily would not take, but would take, if necessary, to realize an estimated $3.3 million in U.S. deferred tax assets. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. Our stock price has historically been volatile. From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, the trading price of our common stock ranged from $27.75 to $2.81. Many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:  variations in our quarterly results of operations;  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  changing needs of military customers;  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;  the hiring or departure of key personnel;  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors;  market conditions in our industries; and  the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In addition, the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Major stock market indices experienced dramatic declines in 2008. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a companys stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities litigation against that company. Any such litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses defending against the claim, divert the time and attention of our management and result in significant damages. Acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results. We evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise. The expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions, such as during the third quarter of 2006, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own. Moreover, we may be unable to realize the financial, operational and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition. Competition for acquisition opportunities could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. Further, our approach to acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as:  charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw;  diversion of our managements time, attention, and resources;  loss of key acquired personnel;  increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative systems including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  dilutive issuances of equity securities;  the assumption of legal liabilities; and  amortization of acquired intangible assets. 21 Table of Contents Our charter and by-laws and Delaware law may deter takeovers. Our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive. These provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election of directors. These provisions relate to:  the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, and determine its terms, without a stockholder vote;  the classification of our Board of Directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders;  the limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote;  the prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent;  the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.
