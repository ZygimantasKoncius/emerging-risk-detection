Duties of Directors Under our governing statute, our directors have a duty of loyalty  to act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests. They also have a duty to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. A shareholder has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached. The functions and powers of our board of directors include, among others:  convening shareholder meetings and reporting to shareholders at such meetings;  declaring dividends and authorizing other distributions to shareholders; 68 Table of Contents  appointing officers and determining the term of office of officers;  exercising the borrowing powers of our company and mortgaging the property of our company; and  approving the issuance of shares. B. Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers Cash Compensation We paid our directors and executive officers aggregate cash remuneration, including salaries, bonuses and benefits in kind, of approximately $1,450,627 for 2009. Of this amount, we paid $214,083 to four independent directors (of which one of whom became an executive officer during 2009) and $1,236,544 to our executive officers. Share-based Compensation Share Incentive Plan In March 2006, we adopted a share incentive plan, or the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by linking the personal interests of the directors, officers and employees to those of the shareholders and providing the directors, officers and employees with an incentive for outstanding performance to generate superior returns to the shareholders. The Plan is also intended to motivate, attract and retain the services of the directors, officers and employees upon whose judgment, interest and effort the successful conduct of the Companys operations is largely dependent. The maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards of options and restricted shares under the Plan is the sum of (i) 2,330,000 and (ii) 1% of the number of outstanding common shares of the Company on the first day of each calendar year beginning in 2007. As at July 31, 2010, the maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards of options and restricted shares under the Plan was 3,658,700 shares, of which 2,471,011 options and 566,190 restricted shares (in both cases net of forfeitures) have been awarded, leaving 621,499 shares available to be issued. In August 2010, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Plan to increase the maximum number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to all awards of options and restricted shares under the Plan to the sum of (i) 2,330,000 plus (ii) the sum of 1% of the number of outstanding common shares of the Company on the first day of each of 2007, 2008 and 2009 and 2.5% of the number of outstanding common shares of the Company outstanding on the first day of each calendar year after 2009. The amendment is subject to approval by the shareholders at a shareholders meeting. The following describes the principal terms of the Plan. Types of Awards. We may make the following types of awards under the Plan:  options to purchase our common shares, and  restricted shares, which are non-transferable common shares without voting or dividend rights. Plan Administration. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors administers the Plan, except with respect to awards made to our non-employee directors, where the entire board of directors administers the Plan. The Compensation Committee or the full board of directors, as appropriate, determines the provisions and terms and conditions of each award. Award Agreement. Awards are evidenced by an award agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for each award. Eligibility. We may grant awards to employees, directors and consultants of our company or any of our related entities, which include our subsidiaries or any entities in which we hold a substantial ownership interest. We may, however, grant options that are intended to qualify as incentive share options only to our employees. 69 Table of Contents Acceleration of Awards upon Corporate Transactions. Outstanding awards will accelerate upon a change-of-control where the successor entity does not assume our outstanding awards. In such event, each outstanding award will become fully vested and immediately exercisable, the transfer restrictions on the awards will be released and the repurchase or forfeiture rights will terminate immediately before the date of the change-of-control transaction. Exercise Price and Term of Awards. In general, the Compensation Committee determines the exercise price of an option and sets forth the price in the award agreement. The exercise price may be a fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of our common shares. If we grant an incentive share option to an employee who, at the time of that grant, owns shares representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our share capital, the exercise price cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of our common shares on the date of that grant and the share option is exercisable for no more than five years from the date of that grant. The term of an award may not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. Vesting Schedule. In general, the Compensation Committee determines the vesting schedule. Options The following table summarizes, as of July 31, 2010, the options granted under the Plan to our directors and executive officers and to other individuals, individually and as a group. The options granted in May 2006 vest over a four-year period beginning in March 2006. Unless otherwise noted, all other options granted vest over a four-year period (one-quarter on each anniversary date) from the date of grant, and exercise prices are equal to the average of the trading prices of the common shares for the five trading days preceding the date of grant.

Major Shareholders Please refer to Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  E. Share Ownership. B. Related Party Transactions Shareholder Loans In June 2008, Dr. Qu, our founder, chairman, president, chief executive officer and major shareholder, made a loan to us of $30.0 million. This loan was unsecured, bore interest at the rate of 7% per annum and had no fixed repayment term. As of December 31, 2008, we repaid the entire loan together with $737,543 in interest in full satisfaction of our obligations to Dr. Qu. There are no shareholder loans outstanding as of December 31, 2009. 77 Table of Contents Guarantees and Share Pledges In March and April 2007, Dr. Qu fully guaranteed a one-year RMB39 million loan facility from the Construction Bank of China to CSI Solartronics.

Interests of Experts and Counsel Not applicable. Item 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information We have appended audited consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report. Legal and Administrative Proceedings Class Action Lawsuits On June 1, 2010, we announced that we would postpone the release of our financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 and our quarterly earnings call pending the outcome of an investigation by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors that had been launched after we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents relating to, among other things, certain sales transactions in 2009. As a result of the Audit Committees investigation, we have postponed our annual meeting of shareholders. Thereafter we and certain of our directors and executive officers were named as defendants in six shareholder class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and one filed in the United States District court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuits allege generally that our financial disclosures during 2009 and/or 2010 were false or misleading and bring claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. We anticipate that all of these lawsuits will be combined, along with any similar complaints filed, into a single action. In addition, a similar class action lawsuit was recently filed against us and certain of our executive officers in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The lawsuit alleges generally that our financial disclosures during 2009 and/or 2010 were false or misleading and brings claims under the shareholders relief provisions of the Canada Business Corporations Act, Part XXIII.1 of the Ontario Securities Act as well as claims based on negligent misrepresentation. We believe the claims, both in the United States and in Canada, are without merit and intent to defend against the lawsuits vigorously. Shunda On November 12, 2009, Jiangsu Shunda Semiconductor Development Co., Ltd., or Shunda, a former silicon wafer supplier, filed a lawsuit in the Intermediate Peoples Court of Yangzhou against CSI Cells, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Shunda claimed damages of RMB40.0 million (approximately $5.9 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010 of RMB6.775 per $1.00), alleging that CSI Cells failed to perform its purchase obligations under a silicon wafer supply agreement that CSI Cells and Shunda entered into in July 2008. On January 18, 2010, Shunda filed a lawsuit in the Peoples Court of Gaoyou Jiangsu Province, alleging that CSI Cells failed to perform its obligations under a silicon wafer supply agreement that CSI Cells and Shunda entered into 78 Table of Contents in February 2008. Shunda asked the court to compel CSI Cells to take delivery of certain shipments of solar wafers and pay storage costs of RMB60,000. CSI Cells had made an advance payment of RMB3.36 million under that agreement. On February 20, 2010, CSI Cells filed a request for arbitration against Shunda with the Shanghai Branch of the China Economic & Trade Arbitration Commission. In its arbitration request, CSI Cells moved to rescind a long-term silicon wafer supply agreement entered into between CSI Cells and Shunda in December 2007 and requested that Shunda refund a RMB11.52 million (approximately $1.7 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) advance payment that it had made under that agreement. On July 12, 2010, CSI Cells and Shunda entered into an agreement to settle all of the matters described above. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, (i) CSI cells paid Shunda RMB20.0 million (approximately $3.0 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) under the July 2008 silicon wafer supply agreement, (ii) Shunda refunded to CSI Cells RMB2.86 million (approximately $0.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) of the advance payment CSI Cells made under the February 2008 supply agreement and (iii) Shunda refunded to CSI Cells the RMB11.52 million advance payment made under the December 2007 supply agreement. Systaic On February 3, 2010, we filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Cologne, Germany against our former customer Systaic. We are claiming damages in the amount of approximately 4.8 million (approximately $6.38 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 30, 2010 of 1.30 per $1.00), plus interest, as a result of Systaics failure to pay the purchase price for two shipments of solar modules that it ordered in 2009. We delivered the first shipment in March 2009 and are seeking the agreed purchase price of 3.2 million (approximately $4.26 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010), which became due in May 2009. In August 2009, Systaic refused delivery of the second shipment, and we are seeking approximately 600,000 (approximately $780,000 based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010), the difference between the agreed purchase price and the price at which we subsequently sold the shipment to a third party. We are also seeking a contractual penalty of 1.0 million (approximately $1.33 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) pursuant to a framework agreement we entered into with Systaic in June 2009. We expect the court to issue a ruling in September 2010. LDK On July 23, 2010, CSI Cells filed a request for arbitration against LDK with the Shanghai Branch of the China Economic & Trade Arbitration Commission. In its arbitration request, CSI Cells asked that LDK refund (1) RMB10.0 million (approximately $1.5 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) advance payment that it had made to LDK pursuant to a three-year wafer supply agreement that CSI cells and LDK entered into in October 2007 and (2) RMB50.0 million (approximately $7.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on July 31, 2010) advance payments that CSI Cells had made to LDK pursuant to two ten-year supply agreements that CSI Cells and LDK entered into in June 2008. A date for the hearing has not been set. Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends, nor do we have any present plan to declare or pay any dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business. Our board of directors has complete discretion on whether to pay dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends, the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. B. Significant Changes Between January 1, 2010 and July 31, 2010, an additional 142,100 options and 29,125 restricted shares granted under the Plan vested. Except as described above, we have not experienced any significant changes since the date of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. 79 Table of Contents Item 9.
