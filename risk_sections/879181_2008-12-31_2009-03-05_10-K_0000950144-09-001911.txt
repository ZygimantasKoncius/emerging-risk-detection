ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This section summarizes certain risks, among others, that should be considered by stockholders and prospective investors in the Company. Many of these risks are also discussed in other sections of this report. 18 Table of Contents The Companys secured debt becomes due on August 1, 2009. The Company maintains a significant amount of debt. The Company has long-term debt of $233.6 million, as evidenced by a promissory note to the Companys lenders (Lenders) under a previous senior debt facility. This indebtedness is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and matures on August 1, 2009. The Company currently estimates that approximately $226.4 million will be due to the Lenders at that time. The Company will not be able to repay this debt at or prior to maturity from cash flow from operations and existing cash. As a result, the Company will need to refinance the debt, extend the maturity, restructure or make other arrangements, some of which could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Companys common stock. Given the unfavorable conditions in the current debt market, the Company believes that third-party refinancing of the debt will be difficult or impossible to achieve. There can be no assurance that any of the Companys efforts to address the impending debt maturity can be completed on favorable terms or at all. Other factors, such as uncertainty regarding the Companys future profitability could also limit the Companys ability to address the impending debt maturity. In the event of a failure to repay the debt at maturity, the Companys Lenders would have the right to foreclose on substantially all assets of the Company, and this likely would have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity, financial condition, and the value of the Companys common stock. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Trends, Events and Uncertainties and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, as well as reductions from other third party payors, are having a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition and future reductions could have further adverse effects. In the last quarter of 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA). The MMA reduced Medicare reimbursement levels for a variety of the Companys products and services, with some reductions beginning in 2004 and others beginning in 2005. On February 8, 2006, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) was signed into law. The DRA has reduced the reimbursement of certain products provided by the Company and will significantly reduce reimbursement related to oxygen beginning in 2009. On July 15, 2008, the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (the MIPPA) was enacted and will further reduce reimbursement for certain products. These reductions have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on the Companys revenues, net income, cash flows and capital resources. Enacted reimbursement cuts, as well as, pending and proposed reimbursement cuts may negatively affect the Companys business and prospects. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Trends, Events and Uncertainties  Reimbursement Changes and the Companys Response. 19 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2008, the percentage of the Companys revenues derived from Medicare, Medicaid and all other payors was 52%, 8%, and 40%, respectively. The revenues and profitability of the Company may be impacted by the efforts of payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by delaying payments, lowering reimbursement rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case management review of services, and negotiating reduced contract pricing. Reductions in reimbursement levels under Medicare, Medicaid or private pay programs and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Companys revenues and net income. Additional Medicare reimbursement reductions have been proposed that would have a substantial and material adverse effect on the Companys revenues, net income, cash flows and capital resources. Changes in the mix of the Companys patients among Medicare, Medicaid and private pay categories and among different types of private pay sources may also affect the Companys revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to maintain its current payor mix, revenue mix, or reimbursement levels, a change in any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys revenues, net income, cash flows and capital resources. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Highland Capital Management, L.P. controls approximately 48% of the Companys common stock and holds a majority of the Companys $233.6 million secured debt, which may allow Highland to exert significant influence on certain aspects of our business. On April 13, 2007, Highland Capital Management, L.P. filed a Schedule 13D/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting beneficial ownership of 8,437,164 shares of Company common stock, which represents approximately 48% of the outstanding shares of the Company. Highland also is the largest holder of the Companys secured promissory notes that represent $233.6 million of secured debt. Highland could exert significant influence on all matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. Because of its ownership of the Companys debt, Highlands interests may be different than those of holders of common stock who are not also holders of debt. The Company maintains substantial leverage. As a result of the amount of debt, a substantial portion of the Companys cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing debt. The substantial leverage could adversely affect the Companys ability to grow its business or to withstand adverse economic conditions and reimbursement changes. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Company is subject to extensive government regulation, and the Companys inability to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations, financial condition, business, or prospects. The Company is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local regulation. In addition, new laws and regulations are adopted periodically to regulate products and services in the health care industry. Changes in laws or regulations or new interpretations of 20 Table of Contents existing laws or regulations can have a dramatic effect on operating methods, costs and reimbursement amounts provided by government, and other third-party payors. There can be no assurance that the Company is in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that the Company will be able to comply with any new laws or regulations that may be enacted in the future. Changes in applicable laws, any failure by the Company to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or standards, or discovery of past regulatory noncompliance by the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations, financial condition, business, or prospects. Because of reimbursement reductions, the Company must continue to find ways to grow revenues and reduce expenses in order to generate earnings and cash flow. The Company has implemented, and is currently implementing, a number of expense reduction initiatives in response to existing and proposed reimbursement reductions. Reimbursement reductions proposed in the United States governments proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2009, as well as other current legislative initiatives, if enacted, would require the Company to alter significantly its business model and cost structure, as well as the services it provides to patients, in order to avoid substantial losses. Measures undertaken to reduce expenses by improving efficiency can have an unintended negative impact on revenues, referrals, billing, collections and other aspects of the Companys business, any of which can have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations, financial condition, business, or prospects. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company has substantial accounts receivable, and increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on the Companys cash flows and results of operations. The Company has substantial accounts receivable as evidenced by DSO of 51 days as of December 31, 2008. No assurances can be given that future bad debt expense will not increase above current operating levels as a result of difficulties associated with the Companys billing activities and meeting payor documentation requirements and claim submission deadlines. Increased bad debt expense or delays in collecting accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on cash flows and results of operations. New healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health care programs or initiatives may have a material adverse effect on the Company. The health care industry continues to undergo dramatic changes influenced in large part by federal legislative initiatives. It is likely new federal health care initiatives will continue to arise. The Medicare Prescription Drug and Improvement Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on the level of reimbursement. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 will have a material negative impact beginning in 2009. Furthermore, additional reductions have been proposed beginning in 2009 and thereafter. There can be no assurance that these or other federal legislative and regulatory initiatives will not be adopted in the future. One or more of these 21 Table of Contents initiatives could materially limit patient access to, or the Companys reimbursement for, products and services provided by the Company. Also, many states have proposed decreases in Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no assurance that the adoption of such legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of government health care programs or initiatives will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Trends, Events, and Uncertainties  Reimbursement Changes and the Companys Response. The Company depends on retaining and obtaining profitable managed care contracts, and the Companys business may be materially adversely affected if it is unable to retain or obtain such managed care contracts. As managed care plays a significant role in markets in which the Company operates, the Companys success will, in part, depend on retaining and obtaining profitable managed care contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will retain or obtain such managed care contracts. In addition, reimbursement rates under managed care contracts are likely to continue to experience downward pressure as a result of payors efforts to contain or reduce the costs of health care by increasing case management review of services, by increasing retrospective payment audits, and by negotiating reduced contract pricing. Therefore, even if the Company is successful in retaining and obtaining managed care contracts, it will experience declining profitability unless the Company also decreases its cost for providing services and increases higher margin services. The Companys common stock trades on the over-the-counter bulletin board, which reduces the liquidity of an investment in the Company. Trading of the Companys common stock under its current trading symbol, AHOM or AHOM.OB, is conducted on the over-the-counter bulletin board which may limit the Companys ability to raise additional capital and the ability of shareholders to sell their shares. Compliance with privacy regulations under HIPAA could result in significant costs to the Company and delays in its collection of accounts receivable. HIPAA Administrative Simplification requires all entities engaged in certain electronic transactions to meet specific standards to ensure the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information. In addition, HIPAA mandates the standardization of various types of electronic transactions and the codes and identifiers used for these transactions. While the Company has implemented all standards issued to date, including the standards for the National Provider Identifier, there are some state Medicaid programs that are not fully compliant with the electronic transaction standards which could result in delays in collections of accounts receivable. On February 16, 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services published the final rule relative to the enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification standards. Entities found to be in violation of an Administrative Simplification provision may be subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $100 for each violation or not more than $25,000 for identical 22 Table of Contents violations during a calendar year. Prior to the imposition of a penalty, however, the Secretary will seek the cooperation of the entity in obtaining compliance and may provide technical assistance to help the entity comply voluntarily with the applicable Administrative Simplification provisions. The Company is highly dependent upon its senior management. The Companys historical financial results, impending debt maturity, and reimbursement environment, among other factors, may limit the Companys ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, which in turn could adversely affect profitability. The market in which the Company operates is highly competitive, and if the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business will be materially adversely affected. The home health care market is highly fragmented and competition varies significantly from market to market. There are relatively few barriers to entry in markets not included in competitive bidding, and the Company could encounter competition from new market entrants. In small and mid-size markets, the majority of the Companys competition comes from local independent operators or hospital-based facilities. In larger markets, regional and national providers account for a significant portion of competition. Some of the Companys present and potential competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have, or may obtain, greater financial and marketing resources than the Company. The provision of healthcare services entails an inherent risk of liability, and the Companys insurance may not be sufficient to effectively protect the Company from all claims. The provision of healthcare services entails an inherent risk of liability. Certain participants in the home healthcare industry may be subject to lawsuits that may involve large claims and significant defense costs. It is expected that the Company periodically will be subject to such suits as a result of the nature of its business. The Company currently maintains product and professional liability insurance intended to cover such claims in amounts which management believes are in keeping with industry standards. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that claims in excess of the Companys insurance coverage will not arise. A successful claim against the Company in excess of the Companys insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon the operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company. Claims against the Company, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, may also have a material adverse effect upon the Companys ability to attract patients or to expand its business. In addition, the Company maintains a large deductible for its workers compensation, auto liability, commercial general and professional liability insurance. The Company is self-insured for its employee health insurance and is at risk for claims up to individual stop loss and aggregate stop loss amounts. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
